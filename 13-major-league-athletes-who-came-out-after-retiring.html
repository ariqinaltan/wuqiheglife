Rohrer married his partner, Joshua Ross, in 2018 and together they live under the same roof with Rohrer's ex-wife and their two teenagers, per <a href=#>People</a>. It's a happy ending for an athlete who spent much of his life hiding, even from himself. Per <a href=#>Outsports</a>, Rohrer had no gay experiences until his marriage ended, but had known for a long time that he liked men. "So many nights I cried myself to sleep, feeling like I was the Wolfman, or Jekyll and Hyde, or Frankenstein, some kind of monster that only comes out when it's a full moon, always living in the shadows," he said.</p><p>The 2018 Outsports article is when Rohrer first publicly discussed both his sexuality and his impending nuptials, but it came after a few years of privately figuring out his identity, with the help of Ross. This was, of course, long after his time in the NFL had ended. According to <a href=#>The Associated Press</a>, Rohrer was an active player from 1982 to 1989, spending his entire NFL career with the Dallas Cowboys. Per <a href=#>Outsports</a>, when Rohrer and Ross attended a Cowboys reunion event in 2022, he was met with nothing but positivity. "I was super scared headed to Dallas and how it would go down, but everyone was amazing and great. Everyone was totally accepting," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlja4R5go5qamalkZ%2B8s3nLnpigrZVirrW0y56rnqtdrLWwecKapJ5ln6rBbq3FrZyrZaKawaq%2ByKeeaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1521519-wrong-doctors-checking-phones-laptops-prescriptions-ogbonge-doctor-says.html><span>←</span><span>&amp;quot;There is Nothing Wrong With Doctors Checking Phones or Laptops for Prescriptions,&amp;quot; Says Ogbonge Doc</span></a>
