However, the medicine had the unintended side effect of turning him into the first demon. He spent the next 1000 years murdering and eating humans, becoming stronger and spreading his condition to others.</p><h3>How did Kibutsuji Muzan became a demon?</h3><p>Muzan became a demon after taking an experimental medicine crafted by a physician using the Blue Spider Lily. The medicine granted him immortality and transformed him into the world’s first demon. He developed a craving for human flesh and became stronger by consuming humans.</p><h3>Who made Muzan a demon?</h3><p>Muzan was turned into a demon by a generous doctor from the Heian Period. The doctor wanted to save Muzan from his terminal illness and turned him into a demon to prevent his death before he turned twenty.</p><h3>Why did Muzan become evil?</h3><p>Muzan was originally a human aristocrat born during the Heian Era. He became evil after being turned into a demon by an experimental treatment to cure his terminal illness. The treatment inadvertently transformed him into a demon with a craving for human flesh.</p><h3>What is Muzan’s backstory?</h3><p>Muzan’s backstory dates back to the Heian Era, where he was turned into a demon during an experimental treatment to cure his terminal illness. His goal since then has been to live without the fear of death and become truly immortal.</p><h3>Why does Muzan have 7 hearts and 5 brains?</h3><p>Muzan possesses seven hearts and five brains, which are responsible for his powerful vitality. If any of these organs are harmed, he will be severely weakened. He also possesses the fastest and most powerful regenerative power among demons.</p><h3>Why can’t demons say Muzan’s name?</h3><p>The curse of Kibutsuji prevents demons from speaking Muzan’s name aloud. If they do, they will face a horrible demise. One demon, Susamaru, faced this reality when battling Tamayo.</p><h3>Who does Muzan regret killing?</h3><p>Muzan regretted killing his doctor. He believed that if he had been patient, the doctor would have cured him of his illness and he would never have turned into a demon.</p><h3>What is Muzan’s true goal?</h3><p>Muzan’s ultimate goal is to find a way to survive in sunlight and live forever. He desires to live without the fear of death and is solely focused on himself and his own survival.</p><h3>Why is Nezuko immune to sunlight?</h3><p>Nezuko is immune to sunlight because the Blue Spider Lily, a flower with special properties, bloomed near her family’s home. It is believed that Nezuko interacted with and consumed the flower, resulting in her immunity to sunlight.</p><h3>Can Nezuko speak?</h3><p>Nezuko’s inability to speak is one of her defining traits. Although she rarely speaks, there is a theory that suggests a deeper meaning behind her silence. Nezuko’s strong desire to protect her family and her cuteness have made her a popular character among fans.</p><h3>Is Genya a demon?</h3><p>Genya is not a demon. He possesses a special ability that allows him to temporarily turn into a demon using his bite strength and special digestive organs.</p><h3>Who killed Muzan?</h3><p>Tanjiro Kamado, along with his companions Zenitsu, Nezuko, Inosuke, and Kanao, played a crucial role in killing Muzan. Tanjiro, in his Demon King form, mentally defeated Muzan, leading to his demise.</p><h3>Who turned Nezuko into a demon?</h3><p>Nezuko and her older brother Tanjiro Kamado are the only survivors of an incident that resulted in the loss of their entire family. Nezuko was turned into a demon by Muzan Kibutsuji, the Demon King. However, Nezuko still exhibits human emotion and thought.</p><h3>Is demon king Tanjiro evil?</h3><p>Yes and no. In the final Sunrise Countdown arc of the Demon Slayer manga, Tanjiro briefly becomes evil after being transformed into a demon by Muzan. He mindlessly attacks his former companions, but eventually returns to his human form with the help of Kanao’s medicine.</p><h3>Who cut off Muzan’s head?</h3><p>Tamayo, a skilled demon, used her Blood Demon Art to keep Muzan in place while using a drug to weaken him. Gyomei Himejima then appeared and destroyed Muzan’s head, causing his ultimate demise.</p><h3>Why is Muzan looking for blue spider lily?</h3><p>Muzan’s ultimate goal is to attain an immortal body. He believes that by finding the Blue Spider Lily and obtaining the body of a demon capable of withstanding sunlight, he can walk in the sun and live forever.</p><h3>Will Nezuko talk in season 3?</h3><p>In the season finale of Demon Slayer Season 3, Nezuko undergoes a stunning transformation. She gains the ability to speak and becomes more human-like, defying sunlight. This transformation has left fans in awe.</p><h3>How Tanjiro dies?</h3><p>Tanjiro dies fighting Muzan but is quickly revived due to the transfer of blood from the Demon King to him. He temporarily turns into a demon, but Kanao injects him with a special medicine made from Wisteria flowers, returning him to his human form.</p><h3>Why Muzan is afraid of Tanjiro?</h3><p>Muzan fears Tanjiro because he possesses Hanafuda earrings similar to Yorichii’s and uses the Breath of Sun, a technique only used by Yorichii. Muzan sees Tanjiro as a powerful threat and monster.</p><h3>Why didn’t Yoriichi kill Muzan?</h3><p>Yoriichi did not have another chance to kill Muzan after their initial encounter. Muzan realized Yoriichi’s overwhelming power and avoided him as best as he could. Yoriichi would have taken the opportunity to kill Muzan if it had presented itself.</p><h3>Is ENMU a girl or boy?</h3><p>Enmu is a slender young man who appears to be in his mid-twenties.</p><h3>Why is Nezuko not under Muzan’s control?</h3><p>Muzan cannot control Nezuko because she is able to maintain her humanity and block his influence. Her strong desire to protect her brother and her devotion to her family make her difficult to control for Muzan.</p><h3>Why did Tamayo betray Muzan?</h3><p>Tamayo fell into a deep despair after realizing the horrible things she had done to her family. She attempted to kill Muzan at some point as revenge for turning her into a demon, but ultimately lost the battle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6hprBllJ6xbrnUs5inZZKasLC5xGaYZpyVoryvew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-jackson-die-in-band-of-brothers-html.html><span>←</span><span>How did Jackson die in Band of Brothers?</span></a>
