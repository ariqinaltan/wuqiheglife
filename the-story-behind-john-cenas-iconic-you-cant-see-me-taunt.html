In <a href=#>January of 2022</a>, he was a guest of Fallon's again, and the host stated that the wrestling star has appeared on the program an awful lot. There's one thing, he went on, that they've never discussed, and it's perhaps one of the most obvious things to ask Cena. "You've been a guest 15 times. We've never referenced the "You can't see me" move," Fallon said on&nbsp;<a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>&nbsp;(via YouTube). This was the window Cena needed to embark on the very entertaining story of the origins of the taunt.</p><p dir=ltr>According to the WWE star, the move has a two-part explanation. The words "you can't see me" themselves, <a href=#>he told Jimmy Fallon</a>, "[are], like, well, you're not even on my level." According to <a href=#>Sportskeeda</a>, he has won 16 WWE world championships in total, a number only one other wrestler, <a href=#>Ric Flair</a>, has ever reached. Truly, then, there are very few who are on Cena's level. That part of the move checks out, then, but what of the hand movement that accompanies it? That, apparently, was a dare from Cena's younger brother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCElnBqbHBfqbWmedKtpquxXZeyqbXNnWSjp5ijeqSxzZqqZqGTpLuqr4yypq5lk5a7tXnSnpxmpZViwaLBza1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-selling-sunset-season-7-outfits-are-more-ridiculous-than-ever.html><span>←</span><span>The Selling Sunset Season 7 Outfits Are More Ridiculous Than Ever</span></a>
