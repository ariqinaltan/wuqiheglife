According to <a href=#>IMDb</a>, the show follows the <a href=#>Avengers</a> actor as he goes around the world “reimagining unique purpose-built vehicles.” It is set to premiere in early 2023.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Rennervations is set to be a four-episode series that lets Jeremy Renner show off his talent and passion for both construction and helping communities to grow. There is not a lot of information available yet about the specifics of each episode, but we know he will be helping to custom-make vehicles that can improve the lives of the people he comes into contact with.</p><p>Jeremy Renner has been in the movie business since 1995. He started with indie films like 2002’s Dahmer before moving on to roles in the supporting cast of big hits like 28 Weeks Later and S.W.A.T. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for The Hurt Locker, as well as one for Best Supporting Actor in The Town.&nbsp;</p><p>Most fans will know Jeremy Renner best as Clint Barton a.k.a. Hawkeye in the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>. He has played this expert archer in multiple films, starting with 2011’s Thor.&nbsp;Most recently he portrayed the superhero in the <a href=#>Hawkeye miniseries</a>, also created for Disney+.</p><p>This series sees Jeremy Renner return as Hawkeye a year after the events of Avengers: Endgame. The plot follows him as he meets his protege, Kate Bishop (<a href=#>Hailee Steinfeld</a>), an obsessive fan of the superhero who he trains to be the next Hawkeye. The <a href=#>two of them</a> are a quintessential comedic odd couple, with Bishop’s fun, bubbly enthusiasm being in stark contrast to Barton’s seriousness.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hawkeye-review-feature-900x506.jpg><p>There is a lot more going on in Jeremy Renner’s life than just playing a superhero on screen, however. He also runs a house-renovation business with Kristoffer Winters, his best friend, and has frequently trained in martial arts for his roles in action franchises like The Avengers and Mission: Impossible.</p><p>Perhaps most surprisingly, Jeremy Renner also released his own mobile app in 2017. It was called simply “Jeremy Renner” or “Jeremy Renner Official” and was meant to create a community where users shared pictures and memes and celebrated “Rennsday” every Wednesday.</p><p>Unfortunately, the app was plagued with problems. It debuted in March 2017, but before October of the same year, it was already seeing controversy, as accusations of censorship and bullying abounded. It was even possible to make it appear like replies to user messages and comments were sent by Jeremy Renner himself when in reality they were not, and many users were taking advantage of this to send messages to others, acting as him.&nbsp;</p><p>In September of 2019, Jeremy Renner had had enough and asked the creator of the app, Escapex, to just shut the whole thing down.</p><p>Luckily, fans of the actor know that this was just a blip in his otherwise hard-won career, and many of Jeremy Renner’s Twitter followers have already expressed interest in his new Rennervations venture.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iilaeyrsWMq5ynppWneqK6zaisp5uVqHqvsdetZKydop6ytHrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./125139-grant-gustin-calls-out-body-shamers-after-the-flash-season-5-suit-leak-news.html><span>←</span><span>Grant Gustin Calls Out Body Shamers After &amp;quot;The Flash&amp;quot; Season 5 Suit Leak</span></a>
