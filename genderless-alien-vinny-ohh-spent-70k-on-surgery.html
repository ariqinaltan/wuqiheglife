A young person has spent nearly NZ$70,000 (£40,000) on plastic surgery to become &#34;a genderless alien&#34; and hopes to remove their genitalia one day.
Vinny Ohh, 22, from Los Angeles, has had over 110 procedures so far.
The make-up artist identifies as neither male nor female, so their extreme look is a way of mirroring their identity."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
