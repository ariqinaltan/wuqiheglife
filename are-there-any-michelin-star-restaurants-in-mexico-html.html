 There is no Michelin Guide for any Mexican city, so no, there isn’t one. This isn’t because there aren’t any worthy establishments; rather, there isn’t a guide because there isn’t one. New York, Chicago, Washington, DC, and San Francisco are the only cities in North America that have a guide available.

 Just to clarify, do Michelin-starred restaurants exist in Mexico? There are four Mexican restaurants that have received Michelin stars, despite the fact that there isn’t a Michelin guide for every country: Mexique in Chicago, Punto MX in Madrid, Casa Enrique in New York, and Hoja Santa in Barcelona, which is owned by Paco Méndez and Albert Adriá."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
