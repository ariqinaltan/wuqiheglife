However, the <a href=#>musician</a> also has a fairly extensive career&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as a director</a>, having created the 2007 and 2009 remakes of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halloween</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Halloween II, the 2019 movie&nbsp;3 from Hell, and the 2022 film version of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Munsters</a>. The cast of one of Rob Zombie’s most-famous horror movies, the 2003 film&nbsp;House of 1000 Corpses, recently got together for a reunion.&nbsp;</p><p>The reunion, which was shared on Instagram, brought together&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;actor Rainn Wilson, voice actor Chris Hardwick, and Rob Zombie’s wife Sheri Moon Zombie. Their reunion with Rob Zombie came roughly around the 20-year anniversary of the&nbsp;House of 1000 Corpses‘ release. Sadly missing from the reunion were Bill Mosley, Erin Daniels, and William Bassett.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob Zombie both wrote and directed&nbsp;House of 1000 Corpses,&nbsp;which follows a group of teens investigating the legend of a serial killer known as Dr. Satan. As you might expect, the wayward teens end up finding (or rather, being found by) the killer and a local family he works with. The serial killer goes on serial killing, as serial killers are wont to do, and the teens do their best to survive the horror.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob Zombie had directed several music videos before creating&nbsp;House of 1000&nbsp;Corpses, but the 2003 horror movie was his Hollywood debut. The black comedy horror film was reportedly inspired by films from the 1970s such as&nbsp;The Hills Have Eyes&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>.&nbsp;It was so violent that its original studio, Universal Pictures Hollowood, chose not to release the movie after it finished filming in 2000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rob-zombie-house-of-1000-corpses-900x506.jpeg><p>It wasn’t until Rob Zombie re-acquired the rights to the film and sold it to Lions Gate Entertainment that&nbsp;House of 1000 Corpses&nbsp;was released in theaters. Critics hated it (it currently has a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), but the movie managed to earn $16 million off of a $7 million budget. The film’s later cult popularity led to the release of two sequels:&nbsp;The Devil’s Rejects&nbsp;and&nbsp;3 From Hell.</p><p>Rob Zombie’s love of film has led to his directing several more horror films beyond the&nbsp;House of 1000 Corpses&nbsp;sequels and the&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;films. He also directed the 2012 movie&nbsp;The Lords of Salem, the 2016 film&nbsp;31, and a very strange episode of&nbsp;CSI: Miami&nbsp;that involves a lot more gruesome deaths than you’d usually find in the procedural TV series. He also wrote and directed the fake trailer for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Werewolf Women of the SS&nbsp;</a>as part of the&nbsp;Grindhouse&nbsp;double-feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob Zombie’s most recent film, his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PG-rated&nbsp;</a>reboot of&nbsp;The Munsters, was a far cry from the type of film he began his career with by making House of 1000 Corpses. While the horror theming is definitely up his alley, the family-friendly affair is a far cry from his movies that feature blood, death, and grotesque experiments. The movie received a 51% on Rotten Tomatoes, funnily enough making it the third-best-rated movie from his entire filmography.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iqn5d6u7vMm6CeZaKawq%2B1zqdkn6GconupwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1412129-prince-philip-duke-edinburghs-body-carried-a-land-rover-he-designed-16-years-html.html><span>←</span><span>Prince Philip: Duke of Edinburgh's Body Carried on a Land Rover He Designed for 16 Years</span></a>
