The land of sunshine, surf, and celebrities with questionable life choices. But before you pack your flip-flops and head west, there's a burning question (besides "did I pack enough sunscreen?") that needs answering: <strong>who exactly are California's next-door neighbors?</strong> Buckle up, fellow travelers, because we're about to embark on a geographical romp through the Golden State's border buddies.</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:58><strong>To the North: The Land of Hipster Lumberjacks (Oregon)</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:411>Sharing California's northern border is Oregon, the state that practically invented plaid. Here, you'll find towering redwood forests, enough microbreweries to fill a swimming pool, and a population that could subsist entirely on kale and kombucha (probably). Just be warned: if you ask for a non-dairy latte with oat milk in a mason jar, prepare for a lecture on the environmental impact of single-use straws.</p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:81><strong>To the East: Nevada - Where Anything Goes (Except Maybe Using Turn Signals)</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:474>East of California lies Nevada, the state that screams, "Vegas, baby, Vegas!" But Nevada is much more than just glitzy casinos and questionable Elvis impersonators. You've also got the breathtaking scenery of Lake Tahoe, the otherworldly beauty of Death Valley (perfect for that "survived the desert" selfie), and the slightly-less-otherworldly town of Reno, where you can gamble away your life savings... or win big and buy a mansion in Malibu (hey, a dreamer can dream!).</p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:76><strong>To the Southeast: The Grand Canyon State's Not-So-Grand Cousin (Arizona)</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:388>Sharing a sliver of California's southeastern border is Arizona, the state that boasts the Grand Canyon (truly a sight to behold) and a whole lotta desert. Just remember, folks, when it comes to the Grand Canyon, there's a reason why they call it "grand." Don't try to recreate that epic canyon selfie you saw on Instagram unless you have a decent rock climbing permit and a death wish.</p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:67><strong>And South of the Border: Fiesta Time! (Baja California, Mexico)</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:333>Last, but certainly not least, California shares a southern border with Baja California, Mexico. Here's where the tacos are plentiful, the tequila flows like water (well, maybe not literally), and the mariachi music will have you tapping your feet. Just brush up on your Spanish – "dos cervezas, por favor" will get you a long way.</p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:344>So there you have it, folks! The fascinating, flannel-clad, desert-dwelling, fiesta-loving neighbors of California. Now that you know who they are, you can plan your road trip accordingly. Just remember, when it comes to California's borders, the only thing more diverse than the scenery is the cast of characters you might meet along the way.</p>3581240426133906551<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfrLWiwIysq5qslah6o7vRnZyrZZOWuaqyzquloplencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-show-is-colts-mom-on.html><span>←</span><span>What show is Colt's mom on?</span></a>
