According to Hip-Hop Lately, Brooklyn rappers Fivio Foreign and Ether Da Connect allegedly threw down in a brawl outside the Barclays Center where the hyped-up boxing match was on display. Not much is known if these two have beef, but it certainly appears that way based on this news. The footage of the fight has recently been making its way around the internet, especially X. No Jumper shared the video on their account, and it is hard to make out if Fivio actually punched Ether. But if you ask the "Off The Grid" rapper he will definitely say he did.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Betcha that big bozo n**** won’t go live about how I punched him in [the] face outside of the Barclay… I would post the vid of boy running but I don’t condone internet movies." Those were Fivio's words via Instagram stories after the exchange. The drill MC also teased fans that new music was on the way, because why not? One of his henchmen also spoke out saying that he/they, "Put a gun in that n**** mouth."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-fivio-foreign-was-about-that-action-with-ether-da-connect>Fivio Foreign Was About That Action With Ether Da Connect</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Ether Da Connect had a totally different story to tell. He also posted some videos on social media afterwards showing he had no bruises or bumps from Foreign's supposed punches. Ether also thinks his opponent is essentially trying to gain some 15 minutes of fame. "All I'm going to say is cocaine is a hell of a drug."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on the footage from Fivio Foreign and Ether Da Connect's brawl outside of the Barclays Center?
