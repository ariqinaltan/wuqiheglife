Moreover, she reposted the following message: "Careful! We quickly get used to most things and easily forget how amazing they are," and soundtracked it with her song, "Eternal Sunshine." However, some fans called the singer out because she seemed to shade <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ariana Grande</a>'s new album, which is also called eternal sunshine and that came out that same day she posted the message. As such, some thought that this was no coincidence and a deliberate attempt to undermine <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her current partner</a> <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Big Sean</a>'s ex-girlfriend.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Regardless, some fans didn't really see this as a big deal for a couple of different reasons. First, there are the people that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">have their own issues with Ariana Grande</a> and thus justify any attempt, assumption, or claim that paints her in a more negative light. Then, some fans think that Jhene Aiko could've just been a victim of coincidence here, as it's not like "eternal sunshine" is a trademarked phrase. Also, she's not really the type of artist to engage in that stuff too much, or at least it's not a part of how she carries herself online. Perhaps more hardcore fans can confirm or deny this in the comments.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jhene-aiko-seems-to-shade-ariana-grande-on-ig-fans-react>Jhene Aiko Seems To Shade Ariana Grande On IG, Fans React</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, there are some other and more pressing circumstances that Jhene Aiko's probably worried about, which is another reason as to why this is probably innocuous. For example, she was reportedly hit with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a lawsuit over a 2022 car crash for negligence</a>. While this probably won't be a big legal case or anything like that, it's definitely something that takes precedence over attempting to start more drama online. For that reason, we wouldn't be too pressed about a simple IG Story. Still, check out more reactions to it below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-more-reactions>More Reactions</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Regardless, what do you think about this whole debacle and the parties involved? Do you agree with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">criticism</a> of the pop singer or did the R&B star go a little bit too far with these supposed allusions? However you may feel, drop your thoughts down in the comments section below. As always, stick around on HNHH for the latest news and updates on Jhene Aiko, Ariana Grande, and Big Sean.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbIBxg5hmoaGdnpp6orXKqGSaqpmWu6J5xquYp5yVYsCprcOeZJuZk6C5or%2FHZquwoaSpsrN512alnq9dlrmjwcxmpK6rmZh6r7HWrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-aniston-stunning-beach-photo-tropical-destination-the-morning-show-murder-mystery-2.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Aniston looks stunning in tropical beach photo alongside someone special</span></a>
