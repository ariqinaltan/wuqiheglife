And then the other part, if you’ve got a significant part, you’re having to keep your lines fresh.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fjhSwuWkmVi85ixjx7bokf-1920-80.jpg><p>As Us Weekly noted, the Oscar-nominated film Oppenheimer was shot in the middle of a remote New Mexico desert that was home to only one hotel and one restaurant.</p><p>Without a slew of nearby amenities to choose from, the cast was often tasked with entertaining themselves. Murphy, however, wasn't reportedly that interested in participating.</p><p>"The other big thing for me is sleeping," Murphy continued, arguing that he prioritized sleep over socializing opportunities with his coworkers. "I love sleeping and I need sleep. You just don’t have the room … in your head, and you want as much sleep as possible.”</p><p>In a previous interview with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm3AlobdBAY" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Entertainment Tonight</u></a>, Damon clarified that he understood why Murphy isolated himself from the rest of the cast during meal time.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
