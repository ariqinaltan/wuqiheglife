Tropical Fruits was the Lifesavers roll that came in second place all time. Fancy Fruits was the finest, but it was also discontinued a long time ago. Because neither roll is now available, there is no longer any need to purchase the Lifesavers brand.
 Similarly, do they still manufacture life-saving devices? In Canada, the original five-flavor range is still available for purchase. The other original mint tastes have been discontinued as well."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
