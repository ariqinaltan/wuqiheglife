At this time, the Moors ruled part of the Iberian peninsula, and the Christian ruler of Castile, Don Pedro, was trying to get it back. When Abu Sa'id agreed to surrender, Don Pedro invited him and his entourage to a castle to hammer out the details. Instead, the Spaniards slaughtered all of them. Legend says Don Pedro killed Prince Abu Sa'id himself, then searched his dead body for valuables and found the impressive stone.</p><p dir=ltr>But Pedro wouldn't have it for long. Forget the Moors, it was his own family he had to worry about. Pedro's half-brother, Henry of Trastamara, attacked Castille, and Pedro looked to England for help. Edward III's oldest son, also named Edward and known as "the Black Prince," came to help out, and left with his now-namesake "ruby" as part of his payment. As for the curse? Don Pedro died within three years, the Black Prince died a painful, lingering death before he could become king, and his son, Richard II, died aged 33 after losing his throne.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCkmpsaWtfqbWmecyoqq1llpa6sMHSZpquqqOawG61zWapqLGRoXqptdKtpquxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./this-must-be-the-place-naive-melody.html><span>←</span><span>Talking Heads - This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody) Lyrics Meaning</span></a>
