There’s now a <a href=# rel=nofollow><span>Showstealer</span> Pro Trial Version webpage</a> that touts its connection to the latest season of Arrested Development.</p><p>Another irony in the torrent activity around Arrested Development comes from comments made by Netflix’s chief content officer <strong>Ted Sarandos</strong> earlier this month. In reaction to a question about what Netflix was doing to combat piracy, <a href=# rel=nofollow>he told one publication</a> that “BitTorrent traffic drops as the Netflix traffic grows.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: Portraits of Will Arnett, Jason Bateman and the Stars of Netflix</strong></a></p><p>That caused BitTorrent to blog a reaction. In a post titled “<a href=# rel=nofollow>Reports of Our Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated</a>,” the vice president of marketing at BitTorrent agreed with Sarandos that making content more accessible would curb piracy, but disputed “the assertion that BitTorrent traffic drops as Netflix is introduced to new markets.”</p><p>E-mail: eriq.gardner@thr.com; Twitter: @eriqgardner</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmmqqimsC1scNmm56ulaG8sbnEp6tmqJmnrrWxw2akqKqVYn5xfI9pZ2ZtZW5%2FcYGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amelia-drape-age-wiki-biography-net-worth-married-husband-height-html.html><span>←</span><span>Amelia Drape Age Wiki, Biography Net Worth, Married, Husband, Height</span></a>
