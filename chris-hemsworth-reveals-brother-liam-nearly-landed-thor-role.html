Chris Hemsworth almost missed out on the role of Thor to his younger brother Liam.
The 38-year-old actor reprises his role as the God of Thunder in the new Marvel blockbuster &#34;Thor: Love and Thunder&#34; but revealed his younger sibling very nearly got the part instead.
Chris's older brother Luke plays an actor version of Thor in the new movie and the star teased the possibility of Liam appearing as a multiverse alternative of the superhero."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
