One more match, possibly in the Round of 16, Yobo will clock 100.</p><p>Already, along with goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama who is also approaching 100 caps, Yobo is playing in his third World Cup.</p><p>Yobo made his debut with the Super Eagles on March 24, 2001 in a 2002 Africa Nations Cup qualifier against Zambia in Chingola.</p><p>Nigeria pulled a 1-1 draw to ease to Mali 2002. Until the moment he sustained injury in a Nigeria versus Benin match at the 2010 Africa Nations Cup in Angola, he held the record of playing every minute of Nigeria’s Africa Nations Cup matches from Mali 2002 through Tunisia 2004, Egypt 2006 and Ghana 2008.</p><p>It was only at the second match of the 2010 Africa Nations Cup that he was first substituted after a straight 23 Africa Nations Cup matches including two that stretched into extra time.</p><p>It was in the 24th match he was first substituted.</p><p>Though seen as a rookie who was having his third cap in the Super Eagles, Yobo was handed the task of marking the renowned George Weah who had been the World Footballer of the Year 1996 as well as that of Africa and Europe.</p><p>Yobo did a yeoman’s job. A player who graduated as a Flying Eagles’ attacker to play a defensive role in the senior side, he was wonderful playing from the right hand side.</p><p>Yobo scored his first goal for Nigeria in the 2003 LG Cup final against Cameroon in Lagos. He also scored the only goal in the 2006 World Cup qualifier against Algeria in Abuja.</p><p>His goals were also crucial in Nigeria’s march to South Africa 2010 World Cup. Yobo scored the lone goal in the away duels with Sierra Leone and Equatorial Guinea.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkwLG70a2qaJ6fpMGjrculZnJrZm5%2FboKXb2xyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jorge-a-jimenez-net-worth-67344.html><span>←</span><span>Jorge A.
