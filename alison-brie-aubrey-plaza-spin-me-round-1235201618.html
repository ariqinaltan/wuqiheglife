He had sort of beaded out the main plot points and I got to come in and really dig into the characters with him.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The film co-stars <a href=# id=auto-tag_aubrey-plaza_1 data-tag=aubrey-plaza>Aubrey Plaza</a>, Molly Shannon, Fred Armisen and Debby Ryan, who have all worked with Baena and Brie on their previous films; Brie joked they’re creating a “Baena-verse” and explained why she works so well with Baena and Plaza, who are married.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The three of us love film, we love filmmaking, we love independent film, so it’s really fun to work with them because they’re so unique in the way that they think about film and storytelling,” she said. “It’s just really satisfying to work on something where the sky’s the limit and you can follow your imagination wherever it goes.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Plaza said she took on a smaller role in this project as she was working on her new film Emily the Criminal at the same time, opting to become “the cast cheerleader — I was organizing all the social activities, driving people around Tuscany.” And what did those social activities look like? “Just dinners, basically. That’s what you do in Italy: You drink and have long dinners.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Plaza also celebrated reuniting with several of their longtime comedy friends for the film, noting that Baena “has a shorthand with all of these actors, so I think it just makes the process more fun. When you’re shooting movies it’s a tough life; it’s hard when you’re shooting small movies, so it’s good to feel like it’s all in the family and we’re all friends. It just makes the experience that much richer.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Spin Me Round hits theaters Friday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKK4yKymp2WSp7amecCumaudqWK9ra3ZmmSsqJmjeq6xjKumrqaUYn5zf5RrZ2puYW18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./colin-farrell-netflix-3-html.html><span>←</span><span>A Chilling Colin Farrell Movie Is Now Available On Netflix</span></a>
