Yeah, I think even Broly would be taller than him. Well Broli is one of the biggest characters in the franchise, isn't he?</p><h2>How tall is vegito blue?</h2>Appearance. Vegito is a mixture of both Goku and Vegeta's characteristics. He is approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall, about the same height as Goku.<h2>Is Yamcha taller than Goku?</h2>Animators throughout Dragonball (including the manga), generally have Yamcha closer to Ten than he is to Goku, which establishes the fact that Yamcha is depicted the most consistent, being around 5'11"-6'0". Goku is not a tall man no matter how much one wants him to be perceived to be around 6 feet tall.<h2>Why is krillin bald?</h2>Krillin in Dragon Ball Krillin is not naturally bald. Due to his original monastic training, he merely shaves his head.<h2>Who is the tallest Super Saiyan?</h2><p>Heights - from shorter to taller</p><ul><li>7'4" / 223 cm - Kami (old)</li><li>7'5" / 226 cm - Piccolo.</li><li>7'7" / 230 cm - DBZ Broly (Base form)</li><li>8'2" / 250 cm - King Piccolo.</li><li>8'2" / 250 cm - Kami (prime)</li><li>9'0" / 274 cm - DBZ Broly (Legendary Super Saiyan)</li><li>9'10" / 300 cm - DBS Broly (Super Saiyan full power)</li><li>Over 13' / 400 cm - Ox-King.</li></ul><h2>Who is the weakest Z Warrior?</h2>The weakest Z fighter would obviously Chiaotzu, even if you did count Yajirobe as a Z fighter. Chiaotzu couldn't beat Krillin in the Tien Shinhan saga, but Yajirobe kills Cymball right after that, Chiaotzu is a terrible fighter, more like Tien's dog, once again, only thing he could do was blow himself up.<h2>Who is fastest in DBZ?</h2>1 Zeno's Grand Priest Is The Fastest Entity In Existence<p>Dragon Ball Super attempts to subvert expectations with how the ultimate being at the top of the universe is the child-like, precocious Zeno.</p><h2>How old is Zeno?</h2>7 Zeno (Over 8.5 Million Years)<h2>How tall is Broly full power?</h2>When Broly transforms, he grows to an astounding three meters in height. The aura presented by this state possesses several noticeable differences from the aura presented by the standard Super Saiyan form.<h2>Is gogeta taller than vegito?</h2>Gogeta does appear to be a bit bigger than Vegito, in both body and height. They could possibly be the same height as Vegito stays in a stance which makes him appear a bit shorter.<h2>How old is Frieza?</h2>Judging by his voice, he sounds about mid-40s. Of course, he looks exactly the same on Namek as he did 25 years prior on Planet Vegeta. On top of that, he still has a living father, who is obviously even older.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmaho2LBqbGMrZilpJWowW6wwbNknKCRp66kwMSr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-matt-triplett-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Matt Triplett?
