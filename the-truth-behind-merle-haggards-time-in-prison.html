He also won a Grammy&nbsp;Lifetime Achievement Award, and inductions into both the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and <a href=#>the Country Music Hall of Fame</a>. Bob Dylan called him "herculean," according to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, while <a href=#>Willie Nelson</a> considered him "one of the best." Not bad for an ex-con. Sadly, after a bout with double pneumonia, Haggard <a href=#>died on his 79th birthday</a>, April 6, 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9mGxwa2pfqbWmedOrrK2gXZeyqbXNnWSmnaKhsm60wKCemqqUqHq1tcyeZKKmXaW%2Fqr%2FOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marvelous-mrs-maisel-tupperware-collection-merch-1235373032.html><span>←</span><span>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel x Tupperware Is On Sale for Season 5 The Hollywood Reporter</span></a>
