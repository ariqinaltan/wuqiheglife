The former host of popular UK kids show Art Attack has been forced to deny a wild internet theory that he is elusive graffiti artist Banksy.
Fans became convinced over the weekend that TV presenter, artist and '90s icon Neil Buchanan, 58, is Banksy's alter-ego.
Buchanan's website has since been stamped with a stern official denial asserting that he is NOT the secret identity behind the street artist who also rose to prominence in the 1990s."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Don't even need to look up the cities for confirmation. Neil is Banksy, Banksy is Neil," one Art Attack superfan wrote.</p><p>Another even said they had seen Banksy around 20 years ago, admitting they wouldn't be able to identify him now. This encouraged the poster of the original tweet.</p><p>"In the late nineties/early noughties, someone pointed Banksy out to me at the Notting Hill Arts Club. I also saw him doing a stencil outside my flat in Hoxton at around the same time (hood up). Could I pick him out of a line-up? Absolutely not," they wrote.</p><p>The original poster replied: "So you wouldn't deny that it's Neil even though you've seen Banksy? This is big."</p><p>"If only he'd been wearing his Art Attack jumper," they responded.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>If only.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSus8CMmqutmZOgerTAwKtkp52ZoXqjwcKhmKeZnmKxprrInqpmm5yWtq6%2FjK2fmqxdnbK0ecGapaSrqWSVmZm3gGl7bXFslYyBqYKJjop3jaKInJZtkGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adele-showcases-amazing-physique-jaw-dropping-dress-vegas-residency.html><span>←</span><span>Adele showcases slim physique in jaw-dropping tight black dress for Pride</span></a>
