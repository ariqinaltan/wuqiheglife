Prince Harry has responded to claims from Prince Charles' office that he continued to receive &#34;substantial sums&#34; from his dad following Megxit.
The claims come after Harry's assertion that he was &#34;literally cut off financially&#34; by his family, reports the New York Post.
The Duke of Sussex, 36, complained about the loss of financial support in his TV chat with Oprah Winfrey, telling the talk show host that he was only able to leave the royal family thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
