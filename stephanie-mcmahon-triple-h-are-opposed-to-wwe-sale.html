Mr. McMahon <a href=#>muscled his way back into his Chairman seat</a> on the company’s Board of Directors, and now the company is in search for a buyer. This decision is controversial with fans, and it turns out that they are not alone.</p><p>Triple H is still in charge of WWE’s creative direction despite Vince McMahon’s return. That being said, a possible company sale could see a total change in creative direction and personnel. Vince McMahon, and company shareholders, would stand to make a lot of money.</p><p>A report from <a href=#>Axios </a>states that Stephanie McMahon and Triple H are opposed to Vince McMahon selling the company. There are a number of reasons why they would not want the company to be sold. Stephanie McMahon also stepped down from her role as co-CEO of the company in the process, leaving Nick Khan alone as the company’s only CEO.</p><p>Sources told Axios that Stephanie McMahon and her husband Paul “Triple H” Levesque, the company’s chief content officer and a retired professional wrestler, had opposed a sale.</p><p>Strangely enough, this news came weeks after Vince McMahon stated in a public address that, “WWE has an exceptional management team in place, and I do not intend for my return to have any impact on their roles, duties or responsibilities.”</p><p>We’ll have to see what’s next for WWE, but the opposition to the sale is apparently also shared by those within the McMahon family. Vince McMahon was forced to resign, and he stayed at home for about six months, waiting for the right time to come back and do something he always had the right to do, because it is his company, after all.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this situation with WWE selling the company?
