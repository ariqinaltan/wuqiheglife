The <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">XXL Freshmen </a>hasn't necessarily been in the mix like his other peers but he has grown an incredibly dedicated fanbase. Each song he releases is an instant smash among them, especially with how relatable Wave presents himself.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Like many artists, Rod Wave's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">lyrics have been misinterpreted by fans</a>. A particular line in "Letter From Houston" off of&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Pray 4 Love (Deluxe) </a>has&nbsp;had fans wondering&nbsp;who "Wanda" is on the second verse of the song. Well, Rod Wave does, too. The rapper took to Twitter where he clarified the lyrics for confused fans, revealing he said "wonder" as in, "Wonder do you miss me when I'm busy on the road."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Wonder do you miss me when I’m busy on the roaaaad! Not Wanda Who Tf Is Wanda," he tweeted.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The die-hard fans noted that they already knew this while plenty of others were taken back by this revelation. "we thought Wanda was your Cuzin or something Rod," one fan replied in a tweet. Others replied with memes from Nickelodeon's&nbsp;Fairly Oddparents.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Though it's been a largely successful year for Rod Wave, he has faced his own share of trials and tribulations. Earlier this year, the rapper got into a bad car crash in his new 2020 Corvette that he detailed in the song, "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Through The Wire.</a>" He was also <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">engulfed in a feud with PnB Rock </a>who claims the Florida rapper stole his swag and ran with it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out some of the reactions to Rod Wave's verse below.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
