The lady revealed that when the boy came back from school, their mother called him and said she would like to search his bag.</p><p class=align-left>When the bag was opened, they discovered the love letter he had written to his lover in class. A part of the letter read: "I <a href=#>love you</a> so much because when I set my eyes on you I was like God see this beautiful lady.... I am always thinking about you and loving you."</p><p class=align-left>Many people who read the letter commended the kid's command of English. Others said his handwriting was impeccable. Read the letter here. The video has since gotten over 1400 comments and more than 10,000 likes.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvaa7z6WcaGllaoN2fJVmpaKflae2orqMpqatoJWnerSxxKxkpZmUrnq0tdOtoKefXai8r7%2BMpZipZaKarqTAyKilZqaVqba7sc2sZKysmamwqbHSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./744317-nicki-minaj-love-me-enough-single.html><span>←</span><span>Nicki Minaj Preaches Self-Worth On &amp;quot;Love Me Enough&amp;quot; With Monica And Keyshia Cole</span></a>
