I originally thought, “Well, why wait until the new year to do something I could start now?” The logic was there, but the life experience wasn’t. As a capital-A adult (meaning that last night I literally said “when did groceries get so expensive?”) with a deadline-oriented job, I can now say that I both get it and have succumbed to it. For me, this year is all about starting fresh, and that began with a certain drawer. And based on <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon’s best-sellers list</a>, it seems like we all had the same resolution.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This January, one surprising basic is trending on Amazon: underwear. The brand’s <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cotton multipack</a> has long been a favorite, with over 98,600 perfect ratings. But right now, with many of us looking for easy ways to refresh, the everyday essential has become the number-one best seller.
