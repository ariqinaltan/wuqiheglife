A bF error on a Honeywell Alarm Keypad indicates that there is an issue with the alarm monitoring communicator for your panel, according to Honeywell. If the communicator has been disabled, this indicates that it is not communicating effectively. bF stands for “backup failure” in the error message.
 
What does “trouble” imply on an alarm system, just to be clear? The presence of a trouble signal (often denoted by the acronym TR in the alarm history) indicates the presence of a potential issue or difficulty with your security system, such as a loose wire, a sensor that is not properly aligned, or a low battery condition."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
