He also insisted that he had not said immigrants should be "shot on sight" but that borders can be "respected by choice or by force and choice is not working."</p><p>On Tuesday, Mapp <a href=#>took to Facebook yet again</a>, saying he was "not asking for the kkk [sic] vote" and acknowledged the controversy over the slur.</p><p>"Maybe I could have just used the term illegal, I don't know but that's offensive as well, what do you call those who come here and will not use the border crossing and do it legally?" he wrote. "[W]hat do you call them?"</p><p>"I see the liberal media as race baiting bomb throwers," he added.</p><p>Mapp is one of a handful of candidates vying for Cornyn's Texas Senate seat, including Rep. Steve Stockman. He's also not the first Republican to come under fire for using the slur.&nbsp;</p><p>Alaska Republican Rep. Don Young <a href=#>used the phrase</a> to refer to Latino farm workers during an interview with a public radio station last March.&nbsp;Young eventually apologized for remarks, saying he knew the term "is not used in the same way nowadays and I meant no disrespect."&nbsp;</p><p>He issued a more forceful apology later after facing pressure from GOP leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner, saying in a statement he had "no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words."</p><p class=endmark>"That word, and the negative attitudes that come with it, should be left in the 20th century, and I’m sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform," he added.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rr%2FNm5pnm5%2BifLG7y6Kropujo661tc6nZqCnoGKwqb7IrGSmmaCleqWxxZ6lnatdp66ktcClZKykpad6rr%2FNmmlwbGFsgw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ai-getty-images-ceo-industry-standards-1235869852.html><span>←</span><span>Getty Images CEO Calls for Industry Standards Around AI</span></a>
