In terms of memory speed, you should look for DDR4 memory that operates close to or above 2,400MHz—or 2400MT/s as it'll appear on the packaging and online. Users purchasing DDR3 RAM should look for memory operating at 1,866MHz at least, and the closer to 2,000MHz the better. What RAM speed should I get? Unless you're big on productivity tasks or just simply futureproofing, 16GB is the sweet spot.
