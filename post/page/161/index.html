I'm standing in a pitch-black room. Clutching my brand-new Samsung Galaxy, I wish I could remember how to turn on the camera light. A text comes in: "Is it dark?" Fear takes hold. How did my love for Rihanna guide me through a twisted rabbit hole of dark rooms, anonymous texts and the disclosure of my private information to a nameless Australian man? I respond, "Very." Let's start from the beginning: I am a Rihanna fan.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Shonda Rhimes Reacts to Station 19 Cancellation</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>

Was Hulu miniseries&nbsp;Nine Perfect Strangers&nbsp;an overly complicated story about forgiveness, healing, and&nbsp;wellness&nbsp;or a trippy tale about grifting? Depends on who you ask (and how many drug-induced hallucinations you're experiencing).

According to Owlcation, King Charles I wanted to implement tax reform by increasing taxes on Jacks, or half-pints, but Parliament refused to do so. Undeterred, the king decided instead to simply reduce the volume a Jack would hold, by lowering the imperial measure of the half-pint line, which was indicated by a crown symbol. Thus, Jack "lost his crown" and a reduced volume on the Gill soon followed, or "came tumbling after.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/160/>← Prev Page</a>
