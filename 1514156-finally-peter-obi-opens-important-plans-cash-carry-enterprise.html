office described the rumour making the rounds that the UK authorities liquidated Next International as the "handwork of agents of the political opposition unsettled by the high rising profile of Obi," and are making efforts to make political points out of the development.</p><p class=align-left>The statement reads:</p>“For the records, the entity was 99 per owned by Next (Nig) International Ltd. and established as its buying office in the 90s and Peter Obi as its CEO."At the time Peter Obi became governor of Anambra State in 2006, his wife assumed management of the company, and about one year ago, requested that the company be dissolved under the voluntary strike off of the entity on grounds of dissolution and being inoperational, which is normal in winding up an entity.”<a

resting of Next International (UK) Ltd., the statement said:</p>“When our principal insists that you go and verify facts about him and the information he dishes out, it didn’t say go and falsify facts.“The LP presidential candidate, by his antecedents in Anambra state for eight years, and his records in private ventures, puts himself miles ahead in moral rating.”<p class=align-left>The media office believes this explanation and clarification has put to rest any further chasing of the wind over the matter by "political jobbers" in the opposition camps.</p><h2>"Why I carry Aisha Yesufu
