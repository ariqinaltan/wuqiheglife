The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star had shared some photos from her family's Easter celebrations on Instagram, and while the majority of the comments were positive, one naysayer wrote: "Cut your son's hair." The Poosh founder had the best response, replying: "Most gorgeous hair on earth, anyone who says otherwise ABCDEFG." Kourtney's fans also commented, with one writing: "He has gorgeous hair why would she cut it," while another added: "Do not cut that baby's glorious hair!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4dbbc594c527-kourtney-kardashian-son-reign-easter-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ego4gv7qqeNi data-wc=10><strong>Kourtney Kardashian defended son Reign's long hair on social media</strong></p><p id=eOMvS2Am6GvN data-wc=93>This isn't the first time that Kourtney has spoken out about Reign's hair. In October, the star replied to a follower who had commented on a photo of her son, writing: "She really needs to cut his hair." However, the mother-of-three responded: "She really needs to not worry about kids that aren't her own. He is a happy boy." Kourtney shares Reign, five, Mason, ten, and Penelope, seven, with her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick. While the pair are no longer together, they remain on good terms, and live near each other in Los Angeles.</p><p id=e8eAekxF9-X3P data-wc=32>The pair opened up about their experiences co-parenting in an interview with Poosh in 2019, where they opened up about the benefits as well as the areas that they want to improve.</p><p id=erEtWpYHilW1 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow gives rare insight into relationship with daughter Apple</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d69ad905a88b-reign-disick-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eoTZ493jw8gf data-wc=6><strong>Reign has gorgeous long blonde hair</strong></p><p id=eIcGCLN2Lwip data-wc=81>Kourtney said: "I do think we are very lucky to be doing it this way and we can if we have an issue or something that, you know, one of the kids is going through, we can deal with it together.

The pair also admitted that they were lucky that they see each other most days and that they are flexible with plans. Kourtney said: "Another thing is that I think we're lucky that, you know, if you wanted to have dinner with the kids on a night that they're here, we figure it out. Like it's not a big deal. It's like come and like have dinner. Or anytime that the kids are at your house, I know that I can just go there.
