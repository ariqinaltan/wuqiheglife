Sam Asghari could miss out on a multimillion-dollar payday from his divorce from Britney Spears because of an alleged loophole in their prenup.
The trainer-turned actor, 29, is said to have been set to get $1 million (NZ$1.7m) for every two years of marriage in an agreement he reportedly signed before he wed the Toxic singer, 41, in 2022, but Us Weekly is reporting he is now set to lose out on the cash as they were only hitched for 14 months before he filed for divorce on Wednesday August 16."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
