If you don't know what those are, it doesn't take long to connect the dots concerning what that name could mean in an intimate context. Regardless, she'd previously spoken on how <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she just did that to promote her new card game</a>, and doubled down with a recent tweet. "I was playing!" the Florida rapper tweeted, responding to a fan who brought the golden showers up. "A n***a NEVER EVER PEE'D on me! I did that to promote my card game [dollar sign eyes and tongue face emoji] & it did exactly what I needed to do!!"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, a lot of fans had some heavy debate in the comments for two main reasons. The first was frustration, disapproval, or disappointment at Yung Miami apparently lying and clout-chasing for the sake of engagement and promotion. Of course, there's only so far you can go with this argument before you consider what your favs have lied and been dishonest about for the sake of sales. The second, however, was about her attempts to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">distance herself</a> from Diddy after she came up in one of his many lawsuits, which some people think is too little too late.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-yung-miami-says-she-lied-about-getting-peed-on-by-diddy-again>Yung Miami Says She Lied About Getting Peed On By Diddy... Again</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Regardless of whether or not Yung Miami is trying to disassociate from Diddy, just doing more engagement promo, or will actually face consequences for the Lil Rod lawsuit, fans probably aren't done reflecting on this relationship. After all, even the most vague of comments from either side had fans <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">theorizing and speculating on their status</a>, which would flip-flop all the time. On the other hand, this was Sean Combs' last new romantic relationship before this scandal really erupted, so it's a fresh comparison point for some. That's not to insinuate she has faced exactly the same alleged crimes, but fans were still concerned for her.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Yung Miami <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">became a trending topic</a> when the Diddy and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cassie</a> assault footage hit the Internet, so fans clearly care about her role or implication in the story. We still don't know exactly how connected they are when it comes to the alleged crimes. Maybe we never will, but we doubt that this is the last that we'll hear of this former couple. They have captivated far too many people to ignore.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.

Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
