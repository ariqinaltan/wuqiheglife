She is out of action due to injury and&nbsp;she is still on her journey to recovery so far. Unfortunately, a fake account posing as her might have just damaged an 8-year relationship.</p><p>The advent of social media is a boon as well as a curse, as it has let fans interact with their favorite WWE Superstars even more now. The drawback is the fact that there are many impersonators as well.</p><p>As seen in a video making rounds on social media, a couple was approached and asked to put their trust on the line by exchanging their phones. While the woman was safe, the man got caught texting a fake Liv Morgan account.</p><p>Not only that, but he kept on texting the fake account – which ended up hurting his partner in the process and possibly hampering their 8-year relationship. It was truly painful to watch for fans.</p><p>Liv Morgan’s WWE return remains in&nbsp;<a href=#>limbo for the time being as her injury persists</a>.&nbsp;<a href=#>Morgan is also getting back into shape</a>&nbsp;as she is determined to return to the ring as soon as possible. We’ll have to see&nbsp;when she will be able to make her in-ring comeback, as fans sorely miss her.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed></figure><p>What’s your view on this unfortunate story?
