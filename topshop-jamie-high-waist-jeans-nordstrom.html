And if we can get our hands on a pair of designer-like jeans without the designer price tag, we're always on board.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I used to spend hundreds of dollars on J Brand's, Joe's, 7's… I only spent ⅓ to 1/2 of that cost on the Jamies and not only is the fit better, but the quality is just as good, if not better," wrote another shopper. We're sold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">The coveted Topshop jeans</a> obviously have rave reviews. But a deeper look at their DNA reveals that these are the real deal. They're made from a cotton-elastane mix (91 percent cotton, 7 percent polyester, and 2 percent elastane), which offers the perfect amount of move-with-you-stretch without the risk of overstretching. Bonus: Nordstrom shoppers say even after years of wash and wear, the jeans still hold up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They also have a classic-with-a-twist design. You can't go wrong with a pair of black skinnies, that's a fact, but these come with subtle distress at the knees that elevates their cool factor. What's more, they sit high on the waist and have a five-pocket design for adequate storage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Usually these <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Topshop jeans go for $75 a pop</a>, but thanks for Nordstrom's huge clearance sale going on right now, they can be yours for just under $50. Yep, $50. Buy them today, wear them forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y1u8%2Bsn6ioXZ%2BurrXEZp%2Bin5hixKK10q1ko52Ro8Buus6rm6ysoqS6</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-reese-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Reese Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
