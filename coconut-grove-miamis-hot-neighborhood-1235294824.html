Now it has undergone a $150 million redevelopment with office space, boutiques, health and wellness options, movie theaters and elevated dining added. Two of its restaurants — Ariete and Los Félix — have garnered one-Michelin-star ratings.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Coco Walk is just a block off Biscayne Bay, and the area has a canopy of trees. “It reminds me of Bangkok; very tropical with lots of stone, and it’s become sophisticated without being over-the-top showy,” says Frankland Lee. “It’s low-key, but there are homes across the street from our restaurant going for $18 million.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The area —where Madonna, Derek Jeter, Sylvester Stallone, Christian Slater and LeBron James have owned homes — had a sharp rise in home prices during the pandemic, like so many other places in Florida. At the end of November, the median sales price of a home was $2 million, up from $1.57 million in 2019, according to Lourdes Alatriste of Douglas Elliman. Big sales there last year included the $107 million sale of The Arsht Estate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11-Will-Pryce-Studio-King-H-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Hospitality and condos are part of the renaissance. Just before the pandemic, the Ciprianis opened chic hotel Mr. C Miami (where Jennifer Lopez has checked in and rooms start at $464 night), and are constructing Mr. C Residences. The Ritz-Carlton Coconut Grove (rooms from $599 a night) has updated its restaurant and hired a new chef at its Isabelle’s Grill Room & Garden. The Mayfair House Hotel & Garden has finished a $50 million renovation, with rooms meant to feel like individual homes, and its new Mayfair Grill celebrates wood-fired dishes from Southern California, Arizona and New Mexico. Designer Silvia Tcherassi presented her pre-fall collection at the Mayfair during Art Basel late last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lobby_2.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There’s been a shift because of the redevelopment, and there are more families and people with high net worth,” says Christopher Cuomo (not the journalist), a partner in Groot Hospitality, which owns restaurants and nightspots in Miami and just opened The Key Club, overlooking Biscayne Bay, in Coconut Grove. First-night guests included David Beckham, Pharrell Williams and Lenny Kravitz.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Groot is not the only hot restaurant partnership that spotted the wave and jumped in. Major Food Group, owners of Carbone, opened a location of its all-day-breakfast concept Sadelle’s in late 2021, and Grove Bay Hospitality (Stubborn Seed) premiered the waterfront Bayshore Club last summer.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Grovites” insist, though, that the village is still a bucolic community. Says Ariete owner Michael Beltran: “Even though there is so much new here, Coconut Grove is really old school. You can walk everywhere. It’s the last small town in this big city.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A version of this story first appeared in the Jan. 11 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. <a href=#>Click here to subscribe</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A previous version of this story stated Coco Walk is one block off the ocean.
