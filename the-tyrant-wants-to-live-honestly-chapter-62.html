The chapter revealed some shocking secrets about Dorothea’s bloodline and curse, as well as Reymond’s motivation and feelings.</p><p>The chapter began with Reymond waking up in a hospital after being injured by a dark spirit attack. He was visited by his father, the emperor, who told him that he was proud of him and that he would soon inherit the throne. Reymond felt uneasy and unhappy, as he knew that his father did not care about him or Dorothea, and that he only wanted to use them as tools for his ambition.</p><p>Reymond then recalled his childhood, when he was trained to become the next emperor and the successor of the light spirit’s contract. He was taught to master the light spirit’s power and to suppress his emotions. He was also told that he had a half-sister, Dorothea, who was born from his father’s affair with a maid. He was instructed to ignore her and to treat her as a stranger.</p><p>Reymond was curious about Dorothea, who was always alone and isolated. He tried to approach her and befriend her, but she rejected him and ran away. He learned that she was unable to summon spirits, which made her an outcast and a target of bullying. He also noticed that she had a scar on her chest, which he later found out was caused by a dark spirit’s curse.</p><p>Reymond felt sorry for Dorothea and wanted to help her, but he was afraid of his father’s wrath and the consequences of breaking the rules. He also felt guilty and conflicted, as he knew that he was the reason why Dorothea was born and cursed. He decided to keep his distance from her, but he secretly watched over her and protected her from harm.</p><p>Reymond’s life changed when he met Lux, the king of the light spirit, who appeared to him in his dreams. Lux told him that he was the chosen one and that he would soon form a contract with him. Reymond was excited and honored, as he thought that this was his destiny and his duty. He also hoped that this would make his father love him and Dorothea respect him.</p><p>However, Reymond soon realized that Lux was not a benevolent and noble spirit, but a cruel and arrogant one. Lux treated Reymond as his slave and forced him to obey his every command. Lux also revealed that he was the one who cursed Dorothea and made her unable to summon spirits, as he wanted to eliminate her as a potential rival for the light spirit’s contract.</p><p>Reymond was shocked and enraged by Lux’s confession, and he tried to resist him and break the contract. However, Lux was too powerful and he threatened to kill Reymond and Dorothea if he did not comply. Reymond had no choice but to submit to Lux and to hide his true feelings from everyone.</p><p>Reymond then returned to the present, where he was confronted by Theon, who was also a descendant of the Milanaire family and a candidate for the light spirit’s contract. Theon challenged Reymond to a duel, claiming that he wanted to save Dorothea from her curse and to free Reymond from Lux’s control. Reymond accepted the duel, but he secretly planned to kill Theon and to take his spirit power, as Lux ordered him to do.</p><p>The chapter ended with Reymond and Theon preparing to fight, while Dorothea watched them from afar, unaware of their true intentions and feelings.</p><p><strong>Read Also:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tyrant Wants to Live Honestly Chapter 63 Spoiler</a></strong></p><p><strong>Image Source:- Twitter</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGikmqaYrK5wwMeeZK2xopa7tXnWmqWtq12pvG64yK%2BcZqCfo7K0wMuyZJygkaXBpr6Mb2lo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1518663-original-hourglass-beauty-fans-hail-omotola-jalade-clocks-45-age-photos.html><span>←</span><span>The Original Hourglass Beauty: Fans Hail Omotola Jalade As She Clocks 45, Looks Half Her Age i</span></a>
