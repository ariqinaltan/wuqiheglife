Jackson were friends in real life? The Nicky Fury actor shared that he stood up for his friend Brie Larson when “incel dudes” came at her for being a strong woman with opinions, according to <a href=#>Variety</a>. The attacks on the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Captain Marvel" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Captain Marvel</a> star came from haters on social media who supposedly didn’t like that Brie Larson wasn’t who they wanted her to be.</p><p>It’s well known that Brie Larson faced a lot of criticism and online hate when she was cast as the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s&nbsp;first female-led superhero movie. Some fans felt that the actress was too cocky and egotistical about her role, while others didn’t like that she didn’t appear to smile very much in the Captain Marvel film. It’s refreshing to see a male actor, especially one as badass as Samuel L. Jackson, come to her aid.</p><p>The two actors met on the set of 2017’s Kong: Skull Island and hit it off when they bonded over a mutual distaste for then-President Donald Trump. Brie Larson was upset when it was announced that he had won the presidential election, but Samuel L. Jackson comforted her by saying, “Don’t let ‘em break you. You have to be strong now.” The two have only gotten closer as friends after working together on multiple projects.</p><p>When Brie Larson tested out her directing skills in her&nbsp;feature film debut Unicorn Store she cast Samuel L. Jackson to play alongside her as The Salesman who helps her follow her childhood dreams. The two had great chemistry in the comedic film that was vastly different from their other more gruesome, action-packed movies.</p><p>Both actors were reunited once again when Samuel L. Jackson made his appearance as Nick Fury in Captain Marvel. The two friends got to portray on-screen allies as Nick Fury kept both of his eyes on Brie Larson’s character, helped her regain her memory, and escape from their enemies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/samuel-l-jackson-nick-fury-captain-marvel-e1643925929498-900x506.jpg><p>Brie Larson will continue her role as Captain Marvel (despite the negative opinions of online haters) when the new movie <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="The Marvels" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>The Marvels</a> hits theaters on November 10, 2023. The female-led <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=MCU data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>MCU</a> film will follow Captain Marvel, Kamala Khan, and Monica Rambeau as they work together to save the universe with their entwined powers. The strong female cast includes Teyonah Parris, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Iman Vellani" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Iman Vellani</a>, Zawe Ashton, and Zenobia Shroff, in addition to an appearance from Nick Fury.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson stars in the new TV miniseries <a href=#>Secret Invasion</a> which just released its first episode on Disney+ earlier today. The six-episode series will follow Nick Fury as he and his ally Talos (played by Ben Mendelsohn) try to save Earth from a “secret” Skrull invasion. The show will bring together familiar MCU faces like Don Cheadle and Colbie Smulders while introducing new stars to the narrative <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Emilia Clarke" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>Emilia Clarke</a>, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Dermot Mulroney, and Olivia Colman.</p><p>As Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson continue working together on and off screen, it’s heartwarming to know that the Nick Fury actor will keep supporting the Captain Marvel star amidst pushback from incel men.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iaop6ybrjAq6qopl2orq7BxKVkpWWalrCsv86nZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bobby-tarantino.html><span>←</span><span>Bobby Tarantino</span></a>
