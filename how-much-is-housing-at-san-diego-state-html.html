about braving the waves (metaphorically,</span><span> because dorm rooms rarely have pools) and becoming a proud Aztec at San Diego State University.</span><span> Epic decision!</span><span> But before you trade your childhood bunk bed for a college dorm,</span><span> there's a burning question in your pocket (hopefully not literally – San Diego is dry enough!</span><span>):</span><span> </span><strong>how much will this whole dorm life thing cost?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:219><span>Fear not,</span><span> future Aztec warrior (or scholar,</span><span> we don't judge your

data-sourcepos=7:1-7:59>Brace Yourself for the Base Rate: It Ain't Minimum Wage</h3><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:463><span>First things first,</span><span> there's a base cost for living in a dorm at SDSU.</span><span> This covers the essentials – a place to lay your head that isn't the library floor (although,</span><span> some late-night study sessions might make you question that choice),</span><span> and a meal plan to keep your brain fueled for those all-nighters (because let's be honest,</span><span> college isn't all sunshine and beach days).</span><span> In the 2023-2024 school year,</span><span> this base rate hovered around </span><strong>$18,469 for a 9-month lease</strong><span>.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:248><strong>But wait, there's more!</strong><span> Just like that surprise pop quiz you forgot to study for,</span><span> there are additional factors that can bump up the price tag.</span></p><h3

variety of room types,</span><span> from cozy singles to roommate-filled quads.</span><span> The more luxurious (read:</span><span> spacious and not directly connected to your neighbor's snoring) the room,</span><span> the higher the cost.</span><span> Expect to pay a premium for a </span><strong>single room</strong><span>,</span><span> while a </span><strong>quad</strong><span> with three other Aztecs cheering you on during finals might be a more budget-friendly option (although earplugs are recommended).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:168><strong>Feeling fancy?</strong><span> There are even </span><strong>Flex options</strong><span> that come with private bathrooms and study areas,</span><span> but be prepared to shell out some extra cash for these VIP digs.</span></p><h3

food!</span><span> SDSU offers a variety of meal plans to fit your appetite and budget.</span><span> Think bottomless brunches and late-night pizza cravings?</span><span> A more expensive plan might be your friend.</span><span> Prefer to be a master of the microwave ramen?</span><span> A cheaper option might suffice.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=29:1-29:193><strong>Pro Tip:</strong><span> Do some soul-searching about your eating habits before choosing a plan.</span><span> Wasting money on meals you won't swipe for is a recipe for financial disaster (and hangovers).</span></p><h3
