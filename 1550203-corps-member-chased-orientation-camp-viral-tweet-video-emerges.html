In so much as you're passionate about effecting a change in your world, please be guided with the way you post things. The issue of scrapping NYSC is a done deal! It can't be scrapped just take your mind off it. It is attached to our constitution and it's on the same eve as our national anthem and pledge. If there are things you find offensive and you can't post, pls send to us via DM or other leading social media pages. Stories like this hurt us so much. Guys pls be guided.”<p class=align-left>@rosythrone reacted:</p>“Freedom of speech is far 4rm Nigeria, there's nothing wrong in his tweet, he stated d obvious.
