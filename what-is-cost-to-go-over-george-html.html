it,</span><span> tolls can be a real drag.</span><span> You're cruising along,</span><span> enjoying the scenery,</span><span> singing terribly to the radio (we've all been there),</span><span> and then BAM!</span><span> A tollbooth appears,</span><span> ready to gobble up your hard-earned cash.</span><span> But fear not,</span><span> fellow traveler,</span><span> for today we delve into the delightful world of George Washington Bridge tolls!</span></p><span></span><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:46>The Great Tollsby: E-ZPass vs. Pay-by-Pain</h3><span></span><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:66><span>There are two main ways to pay your George Washington Bridge toll:</span></p><span></span><ul data-sourcepos=9:1-9:5><span></span><li data-sourcepos=9:1-9:5><strong>E-ZPass:</strong><span> This little electronic buddy whizzes you right through the toll lane with barely a blip.</span><span> Think of it as the Invisibility Cloak for tolls (minus the whole invisibility part).</span><span> </span><strong>It's also the cheapest option!</strong><span> During peak hours (when everyone and their uncle seems to be on the bridge),</span><span> an E-ZPass will set you back </span><strong>$15.38</strong><span>.</span><span> Off-peak travelers score a steal at </span><strong>$13.38</strong><span>.</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=10:1-11:0><strong>Pay-by-Mail or Cash (RIP):</strong><span> For those without E-ZPass,</span><span> there's the scenic route – mailing in a toll bill or using the tollbooth (though be warned,</span><span> these haven't seen cash since flip phones were cool).</span><span> This option comes with a hefty </span><strong>$17.63</strong><span> price tag,</span><span> so you might want to consider investing in some carrier pigeons to save some dough (don't do that,</span><span> it's illegal...</span><span> and messy).</span></li><span></span></ul><span></span><p data-sourcepos=12:1-12:168><strong>Remember:</strong><span> Westbound travel (New Jersey to New York) is toll-free,</span><span> so you can pretend you're a pioneer forging a new westward path (minus the dysentery,</span><span> hopefully).</span></p><span></span><h3 data-sourcepos=14:1-14:48>Peak Hours: When Frugality Meets Frustration</h3><span></span><p data-sourcepos=16:1-16:185><span>Peak hours on the George Washington Bridge are like a disco party – everyone's there,</span><span> and it can get a little crowded (and sweaty,</span><span> if you're stuck in traffic).</span><span> These glorious times are:</span></p><span></span><ul data-sourcepos=18:1-18:46><span></span><li data-sourcepos=18:1-18:46><strong>Weekdays:</strong><span> 6 AM to 10 AM and 4 PM to 8 PM</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=19:1-20:0><strong>Weekends:</strong><span> 11 AM to 9 PM</span></li><span></span></ul><span></span><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:115><span>If you're a penny pincher (and who isn't these days?</span><span>),</span><span> avoid these times to snag the cheaper off-peak toll rate.</span></p><span></span><h3 data-sourcepos=23:1-23:71>FAQ: Your George Washington Bridge Toll Troubles Solved (Hopefully)</h3><span></span><ul data-sourcepos=25:1-27:80><span></span><li data-sourcepos=25:1-25:180><strong>How do I get an E-ZPass?</strong><span> Head over to [E-ZPass website] (</span><a class=traceable-link rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>https://www.e-zpassny.com/</a><span>) to set up your account and say goodbye to tollbooth woes!</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=26:1-26:130><strong>What if I forget my E-ZPass?</strong><span> No worries!</span><span> You'll get a bill in the mail,</span><span> but be prepared to pay the </span><strong>$17.63</strong><span> toll rate.</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=27:1-27:80><strong>Can I use any E-ZPass on the George Washington Bridge?</strong><span> Yep!</span><span> Most E-ZPass systems from other states are compatible.</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=28:1-28:173><strong>Is there a way to avoid tolls altogether?</strong><span> Sure,</span><span> if you have a jetpack or a strong swimming stroke.</span><span> Otherwise,</span><span> you're out of luck (unless you go westbound,</span><span> see above).</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=29:1-30:0><strong>Do motorcycles pay tolls?</strong><span> They do!</span><span> The rate depends on the type of motorcycle,</span><span> but it's generally cheaper than cars.</span></li><span></span></ul><span></span><p data-sourcepos=31:1-31:245><span>So there you have it!</span><span> Hopefully,</span><span> this lightens the load (pun intended) of figuring out George Washington Bridge tolls.</span><span> Now get out there and explore,</span><span> just remember to budget for the toll unless you're planning on swimming alongside the fish!</span></p><span></span>7548240514130149845<p class=postsid
