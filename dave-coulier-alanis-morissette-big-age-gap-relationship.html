Because Coulier and Morissette had a big age gap between them when they were dating — she was 18, and he was 33. The song was released a year after they split, and Coulier says he was horrified to realize he was the subject of the scathing break-up anthem.</p><p>"We dated, and she was writing all of that 'Jagged Little Pill' stuff during that time," he told SiriusXM's <a href=#>Faction Talk</a>. Coulier said he had a come to Jesus moment when "You Oughta Know" came on the car radio. "I was like listening to the lyrics going, ooh, oh no. Oh, I can't be this guy," <a href=#>he admitted</a>. "And I went to the record store, bought the CD, and I went, and I parked on the street, and I listened to the whole record."</p><p>The actor said he recognized "a lot of familiar stuff" in the lyrics, and that's when it really dawned on him. "I thought, ooh, I think I may have really hurt this woman," Coulier said. "What do you want me to say when people ask me about this relationship?" he asked Morissette when he saw her years later. "Whatever you want," she told him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampnbn5ygI6dmK%2BdXZi8trjInqlmmZyWu6q%2FjKamq6GjqLK1wMRmmaKfXZa0pnnGmqdmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlotte-flair-husband-wrestling-status.html><span>←</span><span>Charlotte Flair's Husband: Is He Still Wrestling?</span></a>
