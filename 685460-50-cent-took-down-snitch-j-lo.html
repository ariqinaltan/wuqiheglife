So he comes to me and he’s like, ‘Yo, where Mark at?’ I said, ‘I don’t know.’ He says, ‘Call him on the phone.’ So, I put him on the phone, 50’s like, ‘Ay yo listen, I got this n***a here right now, so wassup, tell me what happened.'”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-50-cent-stuck-up-for-prince-markie-dee>50 Cent Stuck Up For Prince Markie Dee</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Rooney continued the story, "The dude was looking around, and he put Mark on speaker, and the dude was saying, ‘Nah, that’s not what happened.’ So after awhile, 50 was looking at him and says he’ll call Mark back. And then, 50 starts pounding this dude, and Jennifer is like, ‘Oh my God.’ She started&nbsp;screaming. Then I told him, ‘Take the n***a outside.’”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this week, 50 Cent took to Instagram to share his thoughts on Bill Cosby's recent <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">lawsuit from former Playboy bunny</a>, Victoria Valentino. Valentino alleges in her lawsuit that Cosby drugged her and a friend in the late '60s, leading to a nonconsensual sexual experience. 50 Cent commented publicly, “They are just <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">doing Bill dirty</a>, smh ain’t no way 54 years ago. Lmao this is just fvcked up Brody!” Cosby and his legal team deny the allegations. The rapper also recently revealed that his highly-anticipated upcoming tour could potentially be his last. He called the tour a &nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"final lap,"</a> adding, “I won’t be running around like this no more. I gotta do my film and television stuff and got a lot of other things going on behind the scenes that I gotta work on. So I won’t be out touring as much as I’ve been touring… I’m having fun this time because it’s set up to enjoy myself, we not feeling pressure.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
