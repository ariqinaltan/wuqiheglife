The reason, said the source? Security.</p><p>“David’s attachment and history go back with William and Kate, and they have a very strong relationship, and they were their choice of wedding guests,” the source said. “They are the people David and Victoria are attached to, and it’s always been about them because they’ve had a long history together.”</p><p>The wedding certainly didn’t lack for celebrity guests, though.
