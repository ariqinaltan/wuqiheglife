Among some of the historical discoveries that surfaced in the library was a letter from high school Hanks to Oscar-winning director <strong>George Roy Hill</strong> complimenting him on his film, The Sting, and telling him “it is all together fitting and proper that you should ‘discover’ me.”</p><p>Hanks admitted that “my looks are not stunning” and “I am not built like a Greek God, and I can’t even grow a mustache, but I figure if people will pay to see certain films … they will pay to see me.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Read the full letter below:</p><p>Dear Mr. Hill,</p><p>Seeing that … I have seen your fantastically entertaining and award-winning film “The Sting,” starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and enjoyed it very much, it is all together fitting and proper that you should “discover” me. Now, right away I know what you are thinking: ‘Who is this kid?’ and I can understand your apprehensions. I am a nobody. No one outside of Skyline High School has heard of me. … My looks are not stunning. I am not built like a Greek God, and I can’t even grow a mustache, but I figure if people will pay to see certain films … they will pay to see me.</p><p>Let’s work out the details of my discovery. We can do it the way Lana Turner was discovered, me sitting on a soda shop stool, you walk in and notice me and — <span data-scayt_word=BANGO data-scaytid=2>BANGO</span> — I am a star.</p><p>Or maybe we can do it this way. I stumble into your office one day and beg for a job. To get rid of me, you give me a stand-in part in your next film. While shooting the film, the star breaks his leg in the dressing room, and, because you are behind schedule already, you arbitrarily place me in his part and — <span data-scayt_word=BANGO data-scaytid=3>BANGO</span> — I am a star.</p><p>All of these plans are fine with me, or we could do it any way you would like, it makes no difference to me! But let’s get one thing straight. Mr. Hill, I do not want to be some <span data-scayt_word=bigtime data-scaytid=5>bigtime</span>, Hollywood superstar with girls crawling all over me, just a hometown American boy who has hit the big-time, owns a Porsche, and calls Robert Redford “Bob”.</p><p>Respectfully submitted,</p><p>Your Pal Forever,</p><p>Thomas J. Hanks</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLWxxKeYoJ1dqbyueceapaSrXay%2FsMDEZphmcGFngnmBjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sofia-richie-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Sofia Richie Wiki, Bio Model Age, Height, Wikipedia, Mom, Parents</span></a>
