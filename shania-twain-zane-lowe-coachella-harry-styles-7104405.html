Of course, the Coachella surprise is now something One Direction fans, country-pop die-hards, and just about everyone else can't get out of their minds when the mention of Twain comes up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was so relaxed about it," Twain said before mentioning that she and Styles had "a casual back and forth" about performing together at Coachella before the big moment actually happened.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was out of the country for that first weekend, and I said, 'Well, I'm not going to be there, but I'll come on the second weekend,'" she added. "He said, 'OK,' and then he comes back to me and says, 'I really want you to do the first weekend.' Like, 'Is there any way?' And I'm like, 'Ah.' You know?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the rest is pop culture history, from the jumpsuit to the set list, which included Twain's hits "Man! I Feel Like a Woman" and "You're Still the One."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn't realize the significance of that moment," she added. "I just saw it as a moment to get together with Harry, but I didn't see it as such a landmark moment ... It was such a wonderful surprise, everyone's reaction."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's the Harries, his age group and even younger. Their moms had my music on, and they're in the backseat, and they know," she explained to Lowe. "At some point, they know every word by heart. They're there with their mom or their grandmother, or they're just there with a bunch of girls because they were little kids together, growing up together, listening to this stuff. Now, it does absolutely make sense, and it's beautiful."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an appearance on the&nbsp;Today&nbsp;show, Twain said the performance was "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>one of the highlights of my career</a>."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qGYp6GRYsG4rcinZLOZnpp6rbvWnmScp5GYtaa4y5pkoZmip8Zuv9Oyo56rXWx%2BcYCTaWw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rose-hanbury-instagram-account-kate-middleton-prince-william-cheating-rumors.html><span>←</span><span>Rose Hanbury's Official Instagram Features a Candid Kate Middleton Pic</span></a>
