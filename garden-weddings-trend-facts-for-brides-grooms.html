A BBQ can also cater to all dietary requirements and doesn’t need to just be meat," Calum advised, before adding: "Food trucks are really popular as they are a fun way to feed your guests and it can ease the pressure off the hosts. Many supply their own cutlery and even offer a clean-up service, they will just require certain things such as a plug socket and water."</p><p id=eoDPLum863wH data-wc=47>Alcohol, however, is where you'll run into problems. "If you are having a free or self-service bar then you will not need to worry about obtaining an alcohol license. However, if you are selling alcohol at your wedding then you will need to get an alcohol licence.</p><p id=eMwtGAJDDqPZ data-wc=26>"To get this, you will need to apply via your local council and complete a Temporary Event Notice application form and pay a fee," he said.</p><p id=eoneZwv00lvr data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Find your dream wedding décor according to your horoscope" class=hm-link href=#>Find your dream wedding décor according to your horoscope</a></strong></p><p id=e388GqmOdAsT data-wc=25><strong>Planning your wedding?
