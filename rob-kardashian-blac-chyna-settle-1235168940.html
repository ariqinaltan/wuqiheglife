The four women had attended most of the proceedings, and all four testified, though they were in New York at the Met Gala when the verdict was read.</p><p>Rob Kardashian, who has a daughter with Chyna, was not a defendant in that trial, but he gave often angry and sometimes sad testimony about the late-night fight that led to the end of their relationship.</p><p>Chyna had initially filed one lawsuit against the whole family, but the judge ruled that the allegations against Rob — which also included assault accusations — should get their own trial. Fewer members of the famous family had been expected to attend the second trial, and only Rob and Kris Kardashian had been expected to testify.</p><p>At the first trial, jurors found that the Kardashians acted in bad faith in their conversations about the couple’s troubles with producers of Rob & Chyna and executives from the E! network, which aired it. But they found that it had no substantial effect on Chyna’s contract or the fate of the show, and she was awarded no damages.</p><p>Chyna’s attorney Lynne Ciani said after the verdict that she and her client were disappointed but felt vindicated by the jury’s findings, which she said demonstrated that Chyna had not physically abused Rob, and validated their claim that the Kardashian women had attempted to interfere with her contract to be on the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLO7wWaimqqUlsCptcCnZJukkZh6pLTYp5hmq5Wpwa2xjGppbG1ha4V6gI9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paola-gutierrez-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Paola Gutirrez Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
