He played the piano and the accordion and tap danced as a youngster in theaters throughout Missouri, Kansas and Iowa before going to college at Carnegie Tech, where he studied painting.</p><p>He first met Mitzie at an audition, and Bob Newhart once opened for them on stage. During an appearance on Jack Paar’s&nbsp;The Tonight Show, he played the accordion while she sang on a version of “I Got Rhythm.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Ken Welch and Burnett worked together for the first time in 1957 when he accompanied her on the piano as she auditioned for a summer stock gig in the Adirondack mountains.</p><p>A bit later, when she needed a new song for her act at the Blue Angel in New York City, they came up with “I Made a Fool of Myself Over John Foster Dulles,” a spoof in the Elvis Presley era about a young girl who falls head over heels for the dour U.S. Secretary of State. He was not a sex symbol, to say the least.</p><p>Audiences roared with laughter, and within days of performing the novelty tune, Burnett was appearing twice on&nbsp;The Tonight Show and on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>The Ed Sullivan Show</a>.</p><p>In the early 1960s, Welch was hired to work on Garry Moore’s CBS variety show, on which Burnett regularly performed, and he created a 1962 CBS special,&nbsp;Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall, featuring Burnett and Andrews. (He and Mike Nichols wrote the song “You’re So London” for that.)</p><p>A year later, Welch wrote musical numbers for 1963’s&nbsp;An Evening With Carol Burnett, and in 1970, he and his wife moved to Los Angeles to work on Burnett’s show starting with its fifth season.</p><p>They couple also came up with material for such TV specials as 1973’s&nbsp;Barbra Streisand and Other Musical Instruments; 1976’s Sills and Burnett at the Met&nbsp;and&nbsp;A Special Olivia Newton-John; 1979’s&nbsp;Dolly and Carol in Nashville; 1978’s&nbsp;The Star Wars Holiday Special; 1979’s&nbsp;The Hal Linden Special; and 1987’s&nbsp;Carol, Carl, Whoopi and Robin.</p><p>Survivors include his daughters Julie and Gillian, a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter who is nominated for an original song Oscar this year for “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings,” featured in the Coen brothers’&nbsp;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.</p><p>A donation in his name may be made to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Doctors Without Borders</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOpJynZaeauaS0jJ2cmpxdmK6zu8tmma6qnprBtb%2BMpaann6SeuqZ5zK6qopuRoXqku8ulmJunopbBsL6MsJisZWlnenJ9l2tvcW5f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-pistons-move-spawners.html><span>←</span><span>Can pistons move spawners?</span></a>
