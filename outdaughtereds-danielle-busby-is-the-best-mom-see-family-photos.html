On <a href=#>reality TV</a>, the star is constantly proving what a mighty mama she is as she chases after her six little girls – Blayke, Hazel, Riley, Olivia, Parker and Ava – and showers them all with love and attention. And when she’s not filming, she’s sharing adorable family photos all over social media — and <a href=#>clapping back at the mom-shamers</a> who dare to try and get her down.</p><p>Luckily, husband <a href=#><strong>Adam Busby</strong></a> always has her back. <a href=#>Parenting is a team effort</a> for these two, and the TLC dad is <a href=#>constantly gushing over his wife</a> on Instagram and defending her against all kinds of hate. The two can regularly be found standing up for each other when commenters offer up unsolicited critiques about how they’re raising their family.</p><p>For the most part, though, Danielle likes to keep her page positive. Her Instagram is filled with sweet pictures of her spending time with her six daughters. “This little one is always so curious [about] all the things Mommy does when we are at my office/shop/warehouse,” she captioned a <a href=#>May 2020 photo</a> with Parker.</p><p>Just a few days earlier, she <a href=#>shared a shot</a> of her snuggled up to Olivia while enjoying a snowy vacation. “My girls, you will never be too old for me to hold and cuddle you,” she promised, adding a heart emoji. Teasingly, she added, “Or so I say for now while you aren’t bigger than me.”</p><p>But even once the quints are all grown up, we know she’ll be there for them just the same — and she’s already proving it with her firstborn daughter, Blayke, born in April 2011. Though it would be easy for the eldest Busby daughter to get lost in the shuffle with five sisters – all of whom were born in April 2015 – running around, mom Danielle always makes time for her OG.</p><p>“I’m so proud to be your mommy,” she <a href=#>told her firstborn</a> on her birthday in April 2020. “[There are] not enough words to describe how amazing of a little girl you are. You are one of a kind.”</p><p>Though quarantine due to the coronavirus outbreak put a damper on the celebrations, Blayke was more than happy to spend time with her family, and Danielle couldn’t help but praise how well she was handling the situation. “We had to postpone your party, and I hate this for you. But you surprise me with your maturity and understanding,” she wrote. “I love you forever, my big baby girl.”</p><p>Since quarantine guidelines have eased, the Busby family has been busy continuing to live their best lives: taking vacations with the entire brood, getting festive no matter the holiday, going back to school and more.</p><p><strong>Check out the gallery below to see all the sweetest photos of Danielle and her daughters.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJopq6slJbCqLTTnqmenKNisaK6yJ6jpZ1dl8K0rthmoKxlpJ2ybq7ErKtmpZ%2BierSxxGadmqWZocZuvMeoq6irXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zac-brown-band.html><span>←</span><span> Zac Brown Band Free lyrics</span></a>
