And the best way to show you DGAF about rumors? Post on Instagram, of course.</p><p>Though influential among the upper crust of her British peers, little was known about this woman who found herself going globally viral in a matter of days. So, we found the Instagram account for their palatial estate, which Hanbury runs, and got an intimate snapshot of her life, her home, her family and her penchant for glamour shots on beds. Oh, and we also spotted a candid photo with Kate in the mix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/prince-william-kate-middleton.jpg><p>Ahead, everything we learned about Hanbury from her 521 Instagrams.</p><h3>Her follows, followers and activity tell a story of their own.</h3><p>Let’s start with some key facts. Houghton Hall’s Instagram follows are mostly all about architecture, fashion, home decor and gardening. But there’s a sprinkling of eyebrow-raising names that appear on the list that give an insight into the former model’s life. In addition to some notable names in fashion, the Houghton Hall account also follows Solange Knowles, Zoë Kravitz and the American nonprofit, Everytown For Gun Safety.</p><p>Notably absent: Kate and William’s @KensingtonPalace and Meghan and Harry’s @SussexRoyal. The same is true vice versa, neither royal account follow Houghton Hall on Instagram.</p><p>Since the news of the Cholmondeley’s rift with the Cambridges first broke in March, Hanbury has shared nearly a dozen posts with her 33 thousand followers.</p><h3>Kate makes an appearance!</h3><p>Hanbury posted a candid photo of her with Kate from a 2016 charity gala the Cholmondeley’s hosted in 2016.</p><h3>She loves reclining on beds, settees and couches.</h3><p>Like, a lot! These glam shots show Hanbury’s modeling days are not quite behind her. Girlfriend definitely knows her angles.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb2A6C3gPRc/</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BVXmw0zgY4V/<br>https://www.instagram.com/p/BPQnIfIDa67/</p><h3>She models in pajamas.
