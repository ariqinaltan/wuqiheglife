He wanted her to use her account with financial company Wise to transfer the money to his family in Colombia.</p><p><i><b>Want to stream your news? Flash lets you stream 25+ news channels in 1 place.

I have Optus chasing me for payment, the gas and electricity people chasing me, my gym has cancelled my membership and I had to sneak into my gym. I feel like I’m living like a fugitive having to request payment extensions for everything,” she explained.</p><p>“My Netflix will be cut off, it’s just crazy. I’ve already been through the annoyance of having to update all of my direct debits as like everyone else I had to a get new card, BSB and account number and I just updated all payments and now they have all bounced.</p><p>“I the lead up to Christmas it’s just annoying. I can’t do any of Christmas shopping, it’s been just a pain.”</p><p><span class=h3><b>‘Lack of empathy’</b></span></p><p>Matilda added she also didn't have a credit card and has been lucky her partner has been able to lend her money.</p><p>“So I can put petrol in my car and live but some other people might not have friends or family that might lend them money in a situation this,” she added.</p><p>“I guess the learning is to have another account with some back up money.”</p><p>Matilda is still fearful her new bank won’t accept the funds and is worried she might not be able to access her money past two weeks.</p><p>The experience had left her “overwhelmed with stress”.</p><p>“I was incredibly stressed. I am a lot more calm now as I know there is nothing else I can do now I have stopped fighting it,” she said.</p><p>But she added had been left “with absolutely no access to any money” for days and it was just not good enough.</p><p>“I’m appalled at their lack of empathy and disorganisation,” she added.</p><p>A spokesperson for Ubank said: “We can’t talk about specific customers due to confidentiality requirements. Ubank is however working with customers who have been impacted.”</p><p>News.com.au has also revealed how a customer from ING had her <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=ac291ce6892b27e357638bcf8380fa1e data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>five bank accounts closed </a>abruptly, while high-profile Sydney sex worker Samantha X too had her accounts shut down with no explanation other than it had been a “business decision” earlier this year.</p><p><span class=h3><b>What is debanking?</b></span></p><p>Debanking, also known as unbanking, refers to the denial of banking services by banks or other financial institutions to customers.</p><p>In a submission to the parliament of Australia, Bitaroo, an Australian Bitcoin-only exchange, said that “banks have the ability to freeze accounts instantly, shut them down with little notice and even ban customers from using their services ever again”.</p><p>It noted “no reason needs to be given and currently no regulator has the power to force banks to reveal the reasoning behind such decisions”.</p><p>Yannick Ieko, CEO of SMSF Loan Experts, told news.com.au that “thankfully this is not a common practice”, but said there were a range of reasons when debanking could occur.</p><p>“Financial institutions work hard to ensure their financial products are not used to support money laundering, terrorism, and other illegal activities,” he explained.</p><p>“They do this for a range of reasons, ie, to comply with the law, be good corporate citizens and to protect their own brand.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“They have sophisticated systems to assess risk and identify potential issues. Where the risk needle rises, so too does the need for institutions to act. When this happens, you see debanking happening more often.”</p><p><i>*Name has been changed for privacy reasons</i></p><p>– with Alexis Carey</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Sydney data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Sydney</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2SvorrKoqWgZ5mrsm6uxJ6lZqSVm8Fuw8itn2amn6l6psLEp2SaZZSkua2t0WarqGWdrnqvrcyeZJudk5bCtLGMqJ1mpalir6K6ymilnq%2BjYsC1u9GyZmlsZGyuen2SbnBqaWJshqOywZyZnGlpaoGjrZVpnHGe</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./it344-upright-pro-style-review-tefals-garment-steamer-wows.html><span>←</span><span>IT344 Upright Pro Style review: Tefals garment steamer wows</span></a>
