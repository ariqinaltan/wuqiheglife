But I don’t want to never say never because you never know what will come down the pike. You never know whether you really want to use Julianna Margulies as a killer or something.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Michelle King added, “We’re trying to remain true to the idea that Elsbeth worked as an attorney in Chicago and moved to New York. It isn’t as though she’s had a memory wipe and she doesn’t remember anyone.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The renewal also continues the Kings’ long relationship with CBS and its parent company Paramount, which dates back to The Good Wife’s debut in 2009. The couple’s other current series, Evil, is slated to <a href=#>end with its fourth season</a> on Paramount+.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Elsbeth also stars Wendell Pierce and Carra Patterson. The Kings executive produce via their King Size Productions, along with Tolins, Liz Glotzer, Erica Shelton Kodish and Bryan Goluboff. CBS Studios produces the series.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">CBS has now picked up 11 of its scripted series for the 2024-25 season, with Elsbeth joining fellow rookies Tracker and NCIS: Sydney and veteran series Fire Country, Ghosts, NCIS, The Neighborhood, <a href=#>SWAT</a> and all three entries in the <a href=#>FBI franchise</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Keep track of all the renewals, cancellations and new series orders on the broadcast networks with <a href=#>THR’s scripted show</a><a href=#>scorecard</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnqOsmpWptW6%2BxKecsJ2UYsCmrdKopWZqXZivtHmQa2pucGdrhnSEjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-ivy-league-schools-used-to-require-nude-photos-of-students.html><span>←</span><span>Why Ivy League Schools Used To Require Nude Photos Of Students</span></a>
