However, his life was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sadly cut short</a> almost four years ago, after being gunned down in broad daylight. Since his death on November 11, MO3's estate has made it their mission to give his die-hard supporters a full look behind the curtain as to what he was working on. Today is another one of those days, as the latest <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">MO3 project</a> to land on streaming is now Legend.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This title obviously is looking to show why the multi-hyphenate was so gifted. So, throughout this tightly packed, 14-song project, you are getting a lot of rapping/singing cuts. Perhaps another reason why this tape is out now is because it would have been MO3's birthday yesterday (May 31), which is when Legend was released. Overall, these songs clearly show that he had plenty of fire tracks waiting to hit platforms.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-legend-by-mo3>Listen To Legend By MO3</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Leading up to this album, four singles were put out ahead of time. In fact, the first one dropped back in 2022, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"They Don't Know"</a> with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tory Lanez</a>. It would not be until May of 2024 that we would get the next promotional track, which was "Tidal Wave". Then, in the subsequent two and a half weeks, "<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Blood Money</a>", and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"AR"</a>, featuring That Mexican OT and BigXthaPlug, would follow. Speaking of features, others include Finesse2Tymes, Fredo Bang, Money Man, Ralo, Tye Harris, and NoCap.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on&nbsp;Legend&nbsp;by MO3? Who had the strongest guest verse? What song did MO3 bring his best stuff? Is this the strongest posthumous release so far, why or why not? We would like to hear what you have to say, so be sure to leave your takes in the comments section. Additionally, always keep it locked in with&nbsp;HNHH&nbsp;for all of the latest news surrounding MO3.
