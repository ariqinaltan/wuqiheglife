The "212" artist started off her day by heading into her yard and&nbsp;<a href=# rel>digging up her deceased cat before boiling its corpse</a> and using its skull as decoration, which&nbsp;caused disgusted fans&nbsp;to&nbsp;react online&nbsp;for the last few hours. She also took time to continue her bullying tirade,&nbsp;<a href=# rel>shifting her focus from Lana Del Rey</a> to body-shame Doja Cat, who is far from overweight.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ8qlYUJZBy</a><br></p><p>"This is disgusting," exclaimed Banks while watching the&nbsp;<a href=# rel>music video for "Juicy"</a> with one of her friends. "Doja, you look fat and you look disgusting. No! This is disgusting. This is pre-diabetic, b*tch! Disgusting."</p><p>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><p>She went on to&nbsp;speak about a conspiracy theory involving China and American beauty standards, before continuing to bully the "<a href=# rel>Best Friend</a>" artist. "This is terrible. Doja, you're fat," she said.</p><p>Doja Cat is one of the hottest artists in the music industry right now. Azealia Banks hasn't had a chart hit in years. It sounds like the New York-raised artist is bitter about Doja's recent success, considering she's the furthest thing from "fat" or "pre-diabetic".&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/_/status/1348919566726881281</a><br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/_/status/1348927335903453186</a><br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/_/status/1348922422318100488</a><br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/_/status/1348915376835469312</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjZ4NygZRmmLOdkaG2onnBmqWkq12XvKXFjKyfmqWVqHqiusNmma6knJ6ytHnDqKGaZZOWwW7Fzq6pnmWWlsFuusSwqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1577136-american-actor-anthony-anderson-spends-night-cape-town-hospital-movie-set-fight-wrong.html><span>←</span><span>American Actor Anthony Anderson Spends Night at Cape Town Hospital After Movie Set Fight Went Wrong</span></a>
