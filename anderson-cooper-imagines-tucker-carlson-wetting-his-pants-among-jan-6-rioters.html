Reacting to senators of both parties <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>speaking out</a> against it, Carlson urged viewers to “keep a list” of their names. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who said Carlson wanted him to appear on his show, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>wrote on Twitter</a> that he would do so after Carlson “admits to his viewers live on air that he has been lying to them about the 2020 elections and about what happened on January 6th.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVflrulsdGspqdlk6S8sbHRZqCmmZeeu6a%2FjK2snKOVp3qkrdGlqqimXayytcDIp55moJmoerGtza2qZpmdpLuoecmapWZuXae2sMDEq6o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./advantages-of-public-universities-over-html.html><span>←</span><span>Advantages Of Public Universities Over Private Universities</span></a>
