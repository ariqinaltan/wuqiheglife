The — for lack of a better word — "brains" behind the operation was a man named W. H. Sheldon, a psychologist from Columbia University who was trying to find correlations between people's body types and their personalities and temperaments. Sheldon developed the theory of "somatotypes," different <a href=#>body types</a> that could explain a person's mannerisms, behaviors, habits, and other pop-psych mumbo jumbo. The words he created to explain these types — ectomorphic, mesomorphic, and endomorphic — are still used to this day, but only to describe general body shapes. His theories linking these physical types to psychological ones have been largely debunked.</p><p>While it may be tempting and facile to believe that certain people behave certain ways, Yale graduate Ron Rosenbaum&nbsp;related what Sheldon was doing to the <a href=#>Nazis</a>, who "compiled similar archives analyzing the photos for racial as well as characterological content." The photos apparently had no pornographic value and were used strictly for a "resolutely scientific nature," which in a way is actually creepier, if you ask us. The project ended up sounding too much like that other now-disproved pseudoscience <a href=#>eugenics</a>, and by the end of his life, Sheldon's theories and studies were no longer accepted by the upper echelons of U.S. academia that had previously espoused them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FkGlrcmpfrLW6ecivsGaklZa0trGMrJqhp5%2BhwG7B0p6bZqyfYr%2BmvdSiqZ5lnqqxpnnPoaatp6NivKd50q2snZ2eqcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-zach-mettenberger-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Zach Mettenberger?
