On February 10, 2023, the Senator was checked into a hospital after feeling lightheaded during a Senate retreat in Washington, D.C.</p><p dir=ltr>Fortunately, Fetterman showed no signs of an additional stroke but spent another night at the hospital. While he appeared physically well, the implantation of a pacemaker and defibrillator following his stroke took a psychological toll. The following day, on February 12, Fetterman checked himself into the hospital for mental health treatment due to depression. He told "<a href=#>CBS Sunday Morning</a>" that he stopped eating and felt indifferent about life, which made it difficult for him to get out of bed in the morning.</p><p dir=ltr>He checked into the hospital to combat these issues, where he remained for 44 days. One of Senator Fetterman's aides spoke out about his treatment, noting he was a celebrity patient. "It shouldn't be something that only a senator may get," they told <a href=#>The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. "It shouldn't be something that is a luxury, it should become the norm, and that's something he's going to fight for." Fetterman returned to the Senate on April 17 and issued the statement, "I want everyone to know that depression is treatable, and treatment works," per&nbsp;<a href=#>CNN</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know needs help with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the <a href=#>National Institute of Mental Health website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampnZX1zhY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGShp6OltrWty6KxnpxdZ31zf44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-i-bet-on-draftkings-in-florida-html.html><span>←</span><span>Can I Bet On Draftkings In Florida</span></a>
