It did, however, make Sting a lot of money. Speaking to <a href=#>Billboard</a>, the English artist joked that royalties from the song were going to put his grandkids through college. How?&nbsp;In case you weren't following music Twitter closely in 2018, Juice Wrld's track samples Sting's 1993 single, "Shape of My Heart," and as a result, Sting was a <a href=#>credited writer</a> who got 85%&nbsp;of the royalties — at least if we're going by an angry, <a href=#>since-deleted tweet</a> from the song's producer, Nick Mira.&nbsp;</p><p>For his part,&nbsp;Juice Wrld told <a href=#>NME</a> that the real number was actually higher. Either way, he wasn't sweating it.&nbsp;"That song is so much more expensive than money and what money can buy. It's so much more touching than what money could touch. That song really saved lives. And people are sitting here telling me, 'Blah blah blah, 90% this, 90% that,'" he said.&nbsp;"They bogus f**ks. No, bro. Without Sting, this wouldn't even be a song. I don't really trip on money, especially with a song like that, with the reaction it's had from everybody."</p><p>Following Juice Wrld's death, Sting told <a href=#>CNN</a> that "Lucid Dreams"&nbsp;was his "favorite of all the many interpolations of 'Shape of my Heart,' it will resonate for many years to come."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9oaoJze9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5ya6gnJ1drL%2BtsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-shady-side-of-david-letterman.html><span>←</span><span>The Shady Side Of David Letterman</span></a>
