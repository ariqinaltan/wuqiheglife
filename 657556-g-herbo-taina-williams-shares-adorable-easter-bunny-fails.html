Having two children, Essex and Emmy, in addition to Herbo's son Yohsohn with Ari Fletcher, the couple has their hands full. And Easter was no exception. Williams gave the internet a good laugh, posting hilarious images of their little one's first encounter with the Easter bunny.&nbsp;</p><p>On April 9th, the influencer and Fashion Nova ambassador shared images of her babies dressed in blue and tan Burberry drip. In the first photo, the toddlers are all smiles. However, in the carousel's next picture, things turn for the worst. A fluffy Easter bunny innocently holds Essex and Emmy as they scream in anguish to get away. The caption reads, "Swipe to see how great meeting the bunny went," with multiple laughing, and crying emojis.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-g-herbo-taina-williams-welcomed-their-second-child-in-2022>G-Herbo & Taina Williams Welcomed Their Second Child In 2022</h2></span><p>This isn't the first time Taina shared pictures of her little ones and their photo mishaps. While at a birthday party in January, the model uploaded a series of images with the caption, "To get a picture with these kids," with multiple eye roll emojis. The first two seemed to show things heading in the right direction, but by picture three, there were tears and stares off into the distance, and once more, Williams' family photo dreams were shattered, though her followers still enjoyed seeing the 25-year-old on mommy duty.&nbsp;</p><p>Williams and G-Herbo began dating in 2019, shortly after his very public and nasty breakup with Fletcher. The new relationship was bombarded with rumors from the jump. For starters, Fletcher accused Herb of cheating on her with Taina while she was carrying his oldest son. She would also allege the "No Guts, No Glory" physically abused her, resulting in him being arrested, also in 2019. He was sentenced to 12 months of probation in that case and a 24-week family violence intervention program in 2020. Things remained rocky between the women, with Fletcher claiming Williams hit her son. The Hype Hair cover star also slammed Herb for being neglectful towards their son while doting over the ones with Williams. Both Williams and Herb have vehemently denied her claims. For now, all appears amicable between the three.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[Via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoR2gZVmnmaglaevsHnTmqCnmV2stq24yJqkrGWjna6zsdJmmJ2nopavrbGMnpisrJWneqPBzaewZp6Rnrm0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1514156-finally-peter-obi-opens-important-plans-cash-carry-enterprise.html><span>←</span><span>Finally, Peter Obi Opens up on Important Plans for Next Cash and Carry Enterprise</span></a>
