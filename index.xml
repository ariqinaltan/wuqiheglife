If you use a little amount of motor oil, there is minimal danger of damage occurring. It will not harm seals, and it will not be incompatible with the hydraulic oil that is now in the system (power steering fluid or maybe an ATF such as Dexron III or type F), since it all originates from the same source material.

Hydroboost brake units provide brake assistance by utilising power steering pressure rather than engine vacuum. This booster may be required if the engine does not generate enough vacuum to assist the braking system on a consistent basis. In the event of a power steering system failure, a spring-loaded or nitrogen gas-charged accumulator is used to maintain pressure.

Microwave for 1 minute 15 seconds on high, or until brie is very soft when prodded in the center. When you microwave the brie, keep an eye on it; if it puffs up too much (risking exploding), turn the microwave off and leave the brie inside; residual heat will continue to melt it.
How does one heat up brie cheese, for example?
