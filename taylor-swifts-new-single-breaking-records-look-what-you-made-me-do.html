Swiftie Nation is undeniably here for the 27-year-old's new music.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But that's not all! The lyric video for "Look What You Made Me Do," which came out on Thursday, also set a YouTube record for the number of same-day views. It finished out the first day with more than 19 million views. No big deal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It goes without saying that a lot of people are excited for Swift's upcoming album Reputation, which will be released on November 10. That's still a fair ways away, though, but there's plenty to look forward to in the meantime. The music video for "Look What You Made Me Do" will premiere tonight at the MTV Video Music Awards, and we're sure there are more singles to come before the album drops.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of that you think of her new song, you can't deny Swift is back in a big way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeklsatu9FmqrChlqnAbrrEsGSsoZ6cuaZ5waucmqOZo7RuvsScpquco2K5sLvKZq6hmaRixrDBjKaYnZ1dorJusM4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./summer-rayne-oakes-net-worth-income-html.html><span>←</span><span>Summer Rayne Oakes Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
