I invested my time with one of my high school friends, Issa Rae, and she loves loyalty. When it comes to some of the, for lack of a better term, hardships that I faced, it's always with casting.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQ8X8q2Ik0 data-wc=33>People just see me as my character Thug Yoda and they say, 'We're looking for someone who is not that character,' but it's like, 'Guys I'm acting. I promise I'm just acting.'&nbsp;</p><p id=eZdt-hixCfF data-wc=13><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;A Day In the Life with So Help Me Todd's Madeline Wise</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/710505a03929-thugyoda.png><p id=e7PqmbqJ-Ci data-wc=88>One of the things I think about sometimes, working in Vancouver on , is that there aren't a lot of people who look like me and it has felt, at times, that I could not be my full self. I have had to keep reminding myself, No Tristen, you belong here. This is in your head because no one is telling you not to be yourself, no one is telling you to behave this way. You are a professional and you earned where you are.&nbsp;</p><p id=evkCTuilAUZ data-wc=95>really changed my perspective on what was possible for me, especially watching Issa being on HBO, the pinnacle of creative activity, and seeing the fruit of her hard work and labor. I would be on set filming and I would think, 'You have to be present, we've got to be in this thing.' Issa continues to be the blueprint for forging your own path in this industry and she just truly makes me believe that sky is not only the limit but it's what we stand on to achieve whatever is next for us.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSG0M_okEXI data-wc=17><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>All-American: Homecoming star Kelly Jenrette reveals what Black joy means to her: 'It's unapologetically being gracious</a></strong></p><p id=eB1Y-hFRRUn data-wc=23><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>CSI: Vegas star Paula Newsome shares what Black joy means to her - and the teacher that helped her to express it</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fa75a30f6242-tristenwinger-2.jpg><p id=eiNjNEROu81 data-wc=93>As Lyle, who is Mr. Black and White, I knew exactly why this man was this way. He could have been one note but I think we've really made him nuanced. When we shot the pilot I sat down with show creator Scott Prendergast and we wrote notes about what I thought about this character — his background, how would he be in a relationship? How he is when he's at work, does he have any friends? What are his interests? Does he have a pet? (I think Lyle is a cat person.)&nbsp;</p><p id=eHfChbWvlA data-wc=41>We'll see what happens in season two but Lyle has never been able to open up to anyone, or feel like someone understands him — and that makes me think about family, and what happens when your family doesn't understand you.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWjRPkvhdT data-wc=12><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;Naked yoga practitioner Jessamyn Stanley: what Black joy means to me&nbsp;</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/103488902b7f-sohelpmetodd-tristen-winger.jpg><p id=eioMVb6x0wL data-wc=41>My mom has always been supportive but she's always been cautious because she doesn't want me to suffer or fail — but a lot of this life is about failing, or falling down eight times and getting up on the ninth.&nbsp;</p><p id=exO5SWd8vi data-wc=95>I strongly believe that the people we are today are a culmination of everything from our past with our parents, our relationships with our friends and lovers all rolled up into one. One of the things that I learned in one of my acting classes was to celebrate yourself within the given circumstances of the scene and the person who does that so well at the moment on screen is Brian Tyree Henry. I see him celebrating himself in everything from to , and I can't wait to see what's next for him.&nbsp;</p><p id=eN96Xk6zF4U data-wc=33>And that is what Black Joy is to me, that idea of celebrating yourself within the given circumstances. It's celebrating who you are, every bit of you no matter what, forever and ever.</p><p id=eFTvkNYMto data-wc=6><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
