Keep a sharp eye out for appearances from big names like Gwyneth Paltrow, Hailey Baldwin, some Kardashian-Jenners, Ayesha and Steph Curry, and a few more of the duo's famous pals.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Here is the announcement. Very excited because we have finally done it. I'm releasing a new song #StuckwithU with my friend @ArianaGrande next Friday on May 8th," Bieber <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a>. "Working with our family at @sb_projects and universal music group proceeds from the sales and streams of #StuckwithU will fund grants and scholarships for children of first responders who have been impacted by COVID-19 in partnership with the First Responders Children's Foundation @1strcf."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the week leading up to tonight's release, Bieber and Grande asked their followers for help. They asked for clips of people having fun during quarantine, saying that the song was "the prom song" for anyone missing out. Previews showed Baskin's submission, though <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>TMZ</a> reports that her clip didn't make the final cut and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a> adds that Grande "did not allow" Baskin to appear.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want to see you guys having fun in quarantine. This is the prom song for everyone who can’t go to prom now," Beiber wrote in an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram post</a> teasing some instrumentals from the track.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"With U by me and @justinbieber. May 8. grateful to announce that my friend and i have partnered with @1strcf and @sb_projects on this release. proceeds from the streams and sales of #stuckwithu will be donated to first responders children's foundation to fund grants and scholarships for children of healthcare workers, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), paramedics, police officers and firefighters serving at the front lines during the global pandemic," Grande wrote in her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>announcement</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Grande and Bieber teamed up during her Coachella set last year and she even gave him a shoutout in the lead-up to tonight's release with another preview post, which showed healthcare workers as well as fan videos.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can’t fully articulate ……… howwwww happy i am that we waited this long to do this (the duet thing). this moment really means so much more than it ever could have if it had happened any other way or if it had been any other song. being able to lend our voices to this project and collaborating on this has been so fulfilling and i really just love this song so much," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she wrote</a>. "Grateful to be doing this with my friend and also just wanted to express an enormous thank u to all of the brilliant creatives who worked on this song @freddywexler @gianstone @iamwhitphillips @skylerstonestreet as well as Universal and all of our streaming partners for waiving their fees and really stepping up in support of this greater cause @1strcf, and of course scooter and allison for working so hard to put it all together. my heart is seriously so full. we’re so close and i cant wait for u all to hear #stuckwithu in a few hours ! love u."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As promised, the song is a slow-dance style ballad that celebrates being together with loved ones. The fan videos range from teenagers dancing and spinning (many in prom-ready outfits) to families and their pets and first responders, nurses, and other medical staff working the front lines of the pandemic. It's sure to be the song of the pandemic (if not the song of the summer) and feel free to stream it on repeat — it's all for a good cause.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeRp7aiusBmnquZnpmybrbUrKuipl2XtqauxKtkrKylmLhuw8itn2atXaLCtLXCZq2inJWk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./386079-a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-reveals-new-album-cover-news.html><span>←</span><span>A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie Reveals New Album Cover</span></a>
