The actor starred in the Hawaiian spin-off of the hit show from 1999 through 2001: at the time, he was just 19 years old. Everyone had to get their start somewhere, right? But while the actor appeared in a popular show, that doesn't mean he's going to go around bragging about it.</p><p dir=ltr>When speaking on the Australian radio show "Fitzy and Wippa" in 2021, the "Aquaman" star admitted that "Baywatch" isn't a regular topic of conversation among his two kids, whom he shares with his now-ex, Lisa Bonet. "We don't say the B-word at home. We hide all of that, mate!" he said of the show. "Never happened, mate! We don't talk about those words. The B-word didn't happen." Momoa also shared that he doesn't let his children see the "earlier things" in his career, but he's allowing them to watch his more recent works that involve superheroes rather than films like "Conan the Barbarian."</p><p dir=ltr>In another interview with <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a>,&nbsp;Momoa talked about the irony of landing the role of "Aquaman," all those years later, which has a similar shirtless vibe as the role that he once played on the lifeguard series. "It's a trip," he told the outlet. "I spent 15 years trying to dig myself out of the 'Baywatch'&nbsp;hole, and now I'm Aquaman. Life is very good."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhmbYN1fo6wn5qsXZ%2ButLvNZqSopZ%2BWerOxwKWjsmWknbavt9JmmJunpal6qbXSZpmasaeWwaS0jJ2Ysqtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-yinka-ayefele-is-yinka-ayefele-still-alive-html.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Yinka Ayefele? | Is Yinka Ayefele Still Alive?</span></a>
