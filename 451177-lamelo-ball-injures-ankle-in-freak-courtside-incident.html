As it turns out, he rolled the exact same ankle that was giving him problems at the start of the year. To make matters worse, the injury seems to be the result of a freak accident.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As you can see in the video below, courtesy of Bally Sports, Melo went down after stepping on a fan's foot. The fan was sitting courtside, and LaMelo just wanted to go for the ball. It was a complete accident, and Ball was immediately grimacing in pain. He then went to the bench and was helped to the locker room.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall, this could be a worst-case scenario for the Hornets. If Melo is forced to miss a lot of time, then the Hornets are looking at a lottery-type season. Fortunately, this could very well win them the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is still a developing story, so stay tuned to HNHH for all of the latest news from around the NBA world.
