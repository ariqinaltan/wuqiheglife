Despite sitting pretty for their mom's YouTube series for about four years, most of the time subscribers weren't seeing much of the girls' personalities (or faces), which led to interest as to who the models were.&nbsp;</p><p>"Since viewers pretty much only ever saw the backs of our heads, they often commented wanting to know more about us," Bailey told <a href=#>People</a>. Brooklyn added, "In a lot of ways, it made sense to start BrooklynAndBailey, what we call a "Grow Up With Us" channel, where our viewers could get to know us better as twins and experience many things that teen girls go through.... getting braces, beginner makeup, babysitting tips, dating advice, budget fashion tips, fun family activities."Just two years after they launched their channel, the twins made <a href=#>Business Insider</a>'s list of 13 up-and-coming YouTube stars to follow. The same year, the twins <a href=#>launched</a> another channel called <a href=#>Squared</a>, a channel by twins for <a href=#>twins</a>.</p><p>Although it might seem like <a href=#>YouTube is their life</a>, the twins' parents have made it clear where their priorities should lie. "Our parents told us from the very beginning that school is our number one job, then family, then YouTube," Brooklyn told <a href=#>People</a>. That's why even though they're still producing content on a weekly basis, the girls are also enrolled at <a href=#>Baylor University</a> where they're both majoring in entrepreneurship. For Brooklyn and Bailey, twinning really is winning.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9jbX1ye8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnBq6aoo5yuu26tzZ1km5mZobK6ecycoqehl53BbrPOrWSfmZ2kwrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harvey-kirby-ross-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Harvey Kirby Ross Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
