The newest trailer, which you can watch below, is focused more on the main character Liv (Rose McIver) dealing with people trying to understand her secret, but I doubt anyone beyond Dr. Ravi (Rahul Kohli) would really understand. Check it out!</p><p><span id=more-113983></span></p><p>You see, Liv suffers from a little thing called “being undead and eating brains in order to give herself a purpose in this world.” Something we can all relate to, I’m sure. And this is not exactly a problem that she can share with her mom, Eva (Molly Hagan) or her best friend, Peyton (Aly Michalka), both of whom wonder just what the hell is going on with Liv, who went from being a go-getting positivity-hound to a sulky, gothed-out sack of misery. It’s not Liv’s fault she was at the wrong party at the wrong time when zombies started going to town on the revelers.</p><p>No one correctly guesses what’s wrong with her, of course, not even her ex-fiance, Major (Robert Buckley). The only one she can confide in is her boss, Dr. Ravi. Instead of taking over the world or whatever big plans she had previously, she ends up getting a job at a coroner’s office, which allows her easy access to BRAINS!!</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/s-578x300.jpg alt=izombie width=578 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>But the brain thing turns out to not just be about getting sustenance to keep her going throughout the day, as she also gains the memories of the people whose cortexes she gobbles up. This, in turn, makes her highly valuable to homicide detective Clive Babineaux (Malcolm Goodwin), who is led to believe that she’s a highly trained psychic. (I’m guessing the percentage of cops who would give up a solid line of closed cases if their “informant” was someone who nibbled on corpse brains wouldn’t be as one-sided as it should.) And so Liv finds a new purpose in life (or unlife) by solving murders and other various crimes.</p><p>Check out the full-length trailer for <i>iZombie</i>, created by <i>Veronica Mars</i>‘ <a href=#>Rob Thomas</a> and based on the comic of the same name:</p><p>Get a bigger bowl of Raisin Brain when <i>iZombie</i> <a href=#>debuts</a> on The CW on Tuesday, March 17, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvIs6ammpmaerW%2BwKKjnqpdpcK1v4yloK9lmaPBpr7VnqWtoZ%2Bje6nAzKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./common-acne-treatment.html><span>←</span><span>This Common Acne Treatment Aczone Kicked My Zits To The Curb</span></a>
