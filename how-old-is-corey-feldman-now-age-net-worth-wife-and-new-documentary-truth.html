mother Sheila in California in 1971, Feldman has a sister and two younger brothers.</p><p>He started his acting career at the tender age of three when he appeared in a McDonald’s advert and soon after had bit parts in various TV shows including Mork And Mindy and Cheers.</p><p>But it was just a warm-up for the international fame that was just round the corner.</p><img

has Corey Feldman appeared in?</h2><p>From the mid to the late 80s, there didn’t seem to be a film out that Corey wasn’t starring in.</p><p>From Gremlins to The Goonies, to Stand By Me and The Lost Boys, Corey was loved for his cute face, his comic timing and his cheeky one-liners.</p><p>He voiced Young Copper in Disney's The Fox And The Hound in 1981 and from there he took over the silver screen in movies like Gremlins, Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter and The 'Burbs.</p><p>He regularly starred alongside his best friend Corey Haim, and they became known as “The Two Coreys” after their work in Lost Boys, License To Drive and Dream a Little Dream.</p><p>The 90s were also fruitful for Corey's career as he starred in movies like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Stepmonster, National Lampoon's Last Resort and Red Line.</p><p>What fans may not know is he also directed a 1997 movie called Busted and was forced to fire his friend Corey Haim when he kept failing to turn up on

Michael Jackson became friends at the height of Feldman’s film career in the late 80s and even went to Disneyland in disguise so they wouldn’t be recognised.</p><p>During the allegations of child abuse against Jackson, Corey stuck by him and claimed the singer never acted inappropriately around him or tried to touch him.</p><p>But in an interview with British journalist Martin Bashir in 2005, he said he was at Jackson’s home when he was about 13 and there was a book on the coffee table featuring naked men and women.</p><p>He told Bashir he didn't consider the nude pictures "a big deal," but became concerned because of the current molestation charges.</p><p>Corey Feldman says he can no longer defend Michael Jackson after details of the singer's alleged sexual abuse of two boys was revealed in Leaving Neverland.<br>The actor, who previously refuted the allegations against his "best pal", said he couldn't stand by "anyone accused of such horrendous crimes".</p><img

five-year court battle.</p><p>In November 2016, he married his long-term girlfriend Courtney Anne in Las Vegas.</p><p>She is one of his Corey’s Angels, a group of scantily-clad&nbsp;back-up performers who wear wings and halos during their appearances with the star.</p><p>Corey said he created Corey’s Angels as a way to help young women break into the entertainment industry, adding that the women must move into his house and abide by his rules in the “Feldmansion.”</p><p>The women are expected to adhere to a strict vegetarian diet, mandatory exercise, and no male visitors on the property unless they are previously invited guests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
