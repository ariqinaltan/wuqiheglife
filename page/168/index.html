A: The white patches on the leaves’ surfaces are most likely caused by a buildup of mineral salts.

One of the earliest civilizations was in the&nbsp;Indus Valley in today's Pakistan. Also known as the Harappan civilization, it originated some 4,500 years ago and was a contemporary of the civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt.
