Chimera, an assault rifle introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Season 1 Reloaded, has rapidly become a favorite among aggressive players who prefer close-range combat. Although the most recent Season 4 Reloaded update did not alter this meta assault rifle, substantial gameplay changes have been made in the last patch. That included players having a higher base health, which suggests defeating opponents with the Chimera will now necessitate a few more shots.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dan Ziskie Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
