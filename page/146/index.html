Answer
The moist part has cement board, while the dry area has drywall, making an outside corner. Are you stating that you should simply use the metal/paper corner bead and drywall mud to attach it, even on cement board? Then just tile thinset over the muck and tile.

Is it possible to put joint compound on cement board in this case? Don’t worry if the tile doesn’t completely cover the cement board-to-drywall junction.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/145/>← Prev Page</a>
