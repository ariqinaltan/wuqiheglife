Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal, the newest entry in Netflix's impressive lineup of buzzy documentaries, is transfixing for the same reason any bombshell report indicting wealthy people is transfixing: We are undeniably obsessed with the rich, and we love (and hate) watching them lose.

Arguably the most damning of them all right now is the lawsuit filed by producer Rodney Jones.

Evidently, Diddy is the one under the most fire.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Chioma Davido Wife? | Who is Chioma Avril Rowland? Chioma Davido Age, Children, Family, Net W</h2><time>Aug 22, 2024</time>

So we live out in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and youAnd we'll end up hand in hand
Somewhere down on the sand
Just me and you
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
We'll drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Just me and you
Lay underneath the harvest moon
Do all the things that lovers do</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/59/>← Prev Page</a>
