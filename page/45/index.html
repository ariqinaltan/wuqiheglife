Harry Styles is sporting a new, slicked-back hairstyle and Twitter is making a note of it.
The fresh haircut—a departure from his now signature long, chestnut locks—was first noticed in late October, after a fan snapped a quick selfie with him and his newly trimmed hair, according to Refinery 29. The change of appearance is most likely due to his starring role on Olivia Wilde's Don't Worry Darling, in which he plays the doting husband of Florence Pugh's character.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How do you fix a broken box spring?</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>
