In the summer and fall, they start holding on to more fat and storing it around their internal organs and under their skin to provide energy reserves when they need it, according to <a href=#>North American Nature</a>. They also shed their summer coats and grow a winter version with thicker, longer hairs called guard hairs, according to <a href=#>TuftsNow</a>. In addition, the animals grow a thicker undercoat for the winter months, and special oil-producing glands give them a natural raincoat by making their coats water-repellent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j3FtbXFoZMSpsdGeZJ2nXZmypr6MrKOenaBitq9506GcZq%2BZo8Gmvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-justice-marie-claire-podcast.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Justice Says She Recognized Her Power as a Child Star</span></a>
