After all, she is a figure that a lot of people are invested in. Moreover, Anthony made some surprising comments about creatives and working for free. Essentially, she believes that creatives should stop worrying about how much they are being paid. Overall, she thinks exposure is the way to create a sustainable career. For the most part, this is a very controversial take that not everyone will agree with. In this economy, many creatives would much rather get paid as much as humanly possible as opportunities can be few and far between.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Regardless, Anthony is doing quite well for herself, even despite the recent criticism. Additionally, she has a great family life and is more than proud of her 16-year-old son Kiyan. Kiyan is a hooper who is in the midst of following in his father's footsteps. He is playing basketball at a high level and has even gone toe-to-toe <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">with Bronny and Bryce James</a>. He recently got to celebrate his 16th birthday, and to help him celebrate, La La allowed him to get a tattoo.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-la-la-anthony-reveals-her-son-s-tattoo>La La Anthony Reveals Her Son's Tattoo</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the Instagram post up above from The Shade Room, you can see La La's Instagram story in which she wrote "I finally let him get a tattoo for his 16th birthday." The tattoo was showcased in Kiyan's most recent Instagram post where he showed off the ankle tat. Overall, it is fairly minimalist as the Old English script says "Creator Of My Own Reality." It is definitely a nice message that Kiyan will continue to follow as he pushes himself to become a great basketball player.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ultimately, there is no telling what Kiyan's ceiling will be. However, it is known that he already <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">has an offer to play for Syracuse</a>. This is because his father Carmelo also played for the Orange, and even won them a National Championship. It's a pretty significant passing of the torch, although only time will tell whether or not he decides to play there.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-a-closer-look>A Closer Look</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
