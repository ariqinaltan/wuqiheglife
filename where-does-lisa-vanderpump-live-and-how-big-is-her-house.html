"I have an abundance of flowers," the <a href=#>well-to-do star</a> told&nbsp;<a href=#>Bravo</a>. "...When you walk into Villa Rosa you smell the lilies and the roses, and I love that about it."</p><p>Before <a href=#>she left The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>, Vanderpump revealed that she and Todd moved into Villa Rosa in an attempt to downsize after their children moved out of the house. You read that right. Their previous pad was 17,000 square feet and sold for $19 million, per <a href=#>Haute Living</a>. This modest empty-nester abode has become LVP's "sanctuary." She told Bravo that she prefers a "neutral palette" and absolutely adores her "white and silver sparkling kitchen with beautiful chandeliers."</p><p>Her pale pink bedroom suite also includes a very cool television that looks like a mirror — perfect for catching up on all the drama that goes down among her reality star friends and family on Vanderpump Rules.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanFnan1xe9ahnKudXZm8pr%2BMpaCsmV2rrq%2BwxKunrqWgYrmqwsRmmKecXZ28uHnBop5moaNitaa%2BjKGmrquVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-state-does-jynxzi-live-in-florida-html.html><span>←</span><span>What State Does Jynxzi Live In Florida</span></a>
