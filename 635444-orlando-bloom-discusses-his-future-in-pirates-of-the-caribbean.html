Over the course of five films, the franchise has earned $4.5 billion worldwide at the box office. Furthermore, Bloom's character appeared in four of the five Pirates of the Caribbean films. The only time he did not appear was in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. However, Will gets his curse lifted in the franchise's, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017). This makes it possible for him to end his time as the immortal captain of the Flying Dutchman.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Recently, Bloom spoke with Parade about his time as Will Turner. They asked him if he would like to return to any of his past roles. He mentioned a potential return as Will Turner for Pirates of the Caribbean 6. Apparently, he would love to come back to the character. Bloom answered, "I think Will [Turner from Pirates of the Caribbean]—I mean Will's so great. I wouldn't mind seeing what Will looked like today in some ways, because he was such this earnest guy. But, after rumbling around the bottom of the ocean for as long as he would have done at this point, it'd be interesting to see how he surfaces and what he's like."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-orlando-bloom-speaks>Orlando Bloom Speaks</h2></span><p>Orlando Bloom attends UNICEF at 75 in Los Angeles at NeueHouse Los Angeles on November 30, 2021 in Hollywood, California.

Plans for Pirates of the Caribbean 6 have been in the works since before the release of Dead Man Tell No Tales. However, these plans were affected when <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Disney parted ways with Johnny Depp</a>. This turn of events occurred because of his defamation trial with his ex-wife, Amber Heard. Additionally, the female-centric spinoff that was supposedly in development has been an object of speculation. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Margot Robbie, who was going to star in the film</a>, suggested that the project is no longer moving forward.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite these claims, Jerry Bruckheimer says the projects are both still in active development. Additionally, each of these films could benefit from Bloom's involvement. Bruckheimer is a producer of the franchise. With the unsure fate of Depp's return as Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner could connect past stories to future installments of the franchise. Furthermore, Bruckheimer is suggesting Pirates of the Caribbean 6 will include a younger cast. One of these characters could be Will's son Henry (Brenton Thwaites). Because Pirates of the Caribbean movies rely heavily on fantasy elements, the former Flying Dutchman would be a wonderful character to include in upcoming sagas. Regardless, Bloom seems very interested in returning to the role.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIJ1gJNmpqukkaOxsHnBpaaopV2ZtrSv1Kyqnqtdnba0ecWuq66qlWK2r3nPoqmarJWoerCyjK2fnmWTlr%2BqrsGemKc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./623244-michael-jackson-biopic-gets-green-light-antoine-fuqua-as-director.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Jackson Biopic Gets Green Light, Antoine Fuqua As Director</span></a>
