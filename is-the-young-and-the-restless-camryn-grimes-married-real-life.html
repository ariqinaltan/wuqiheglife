The actor <a href=#>shared sweet photos of the pair</a> during their romantic getaway to Sedona, Arizona, alongside the caption: "Well, he made it on the grid. Oh boy this is gonna go straight to his head." Opening up about their relationship to <a href=#>Soap Opera Digest</a>, Powell said they met through&nbsp;his mentor, Bill Farmer, who is famous for voicing the Disney character Goofy. "We got along so well," recalled Grimes. "I was doing a demo and Brock was directing it — to do voice-overs you have to do a demo where you kind of showcase all your voices — and we started talking and then lockdown hit."&nbsp;Powell felt their connection was instantaneous.&nbsp;<strong>"</strong>Over time we found out there were things that we had in common,<strong>"</strong>&nbsp;he told the outlet. "I knew immediately that [she was] someone I felt I needed to have in my life in a romantic capacity."</p><p>The "Hotel Transylvania" voice actor said he originally planned to pop the question to Grimes using a stop-motion animated film on Christmas Eve of 2021 but had to push back the proposal a few weeks due to COVID-19. In a recent post, Grimes confirmed that she and Powell intended to marry in San Diego, California. "Brock and I got a venue!! We are thrilled and although we're going to wait a bit to reveal the venue... trust me when I say it is EVERYTHING and more. Extremely us!" she gushed on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxiZYZyfo6iqmasmJp6urvUp55mmZ6ZerW0xGapnqukobK0v4ycmKaqqaN6qL7IppysZZ2Wv7O1xJ1kq52RoXqttcWeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-offering-10-below-asking-price-too-low.html><span>←</span><span>Is offering 10 below asking price too low?</span></a>
