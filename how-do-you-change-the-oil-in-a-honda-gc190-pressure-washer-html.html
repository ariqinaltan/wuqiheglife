Refer to the owner’s handbook for your pressure washer to find out where the plug is located. Remove both the oil drain stopper and the oil filler cap from the pump and allow the oil to flow out of the system. Replace the drain stopper with a new one.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 medrectangle-4 medrectangle-4147 adtester-container adtester-container-147" data-ez-name=ncertpoint_com-medrectangle-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-ncertpoint_com-medrectangle-4-0 ezaw=300 ezah=250 class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span data-nosnippet class=reportline data-ez-ph-owner-id=147><span class=ezoicwhat><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png alt=Ezoic title=ezoic name="?pageview_id=0ba1f9a1-26c6-4436-7d3b-75d58dec82f9&ad_position_id=147&impression_group_id=ncertpoint_com-medrectangle-4/2023-12-26/1517146903056854&ad_size=300x250&domain_id=230869&url=https://www.ncertpoint.com/2022/01/how-do-you-change-the-oil-in-a-honda-gc190-pressure-washer.html" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></span><h3>In addition to the aforementioned, what sort of oil does my Honda pressure washer use?</h3><p>Synthetic oil at the ratio of 10/30 may be used in the engine.

It should be changed at least once every season, and maybe more depending on use.</p><p></p><h3>Second, how much oil does a Honda gc190 use up in its lifetime?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Specifications</p><p><b>Engine Type: Air-cooled 4-stroke overhead cam (OHC)</b></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 box-4 box-4148 adtester-container adtester-container-148" data-ez-name=ncertpoint_com-box-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-ncertpoint_com-box-4-0 ezaw=300 ezah=250 class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span data-nosnippet class=reportline data-ez-ph-owner-id=148><span class=ezoicwhat><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png alt=Ezoic title=ezoic name="?pageview_id=0ba1f9a1-26c6-4436-7d3b-75d58dec82f9&ad_position_id=148&impression_group_id=ncertpoint_com-box-4/2023-12-26/1327732923075507&ad_size=300x250&domain_id=230869&url=https://www.ncertpoint.com/2022/01/how-do-you-change-the-oil-in-a-honda-gc190-pressure-washer.html" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></span><p>Fuel Tank Capacity: 1.9 US gal (1.8 liters)</p><p>The fuel must be unleaded and 86 octane or above.

If you use your machine often, replace the oil roughly every three months, and at least once a year if you don’t. To keep track of when you need to replace the oil in your pump, schedule it at the same time that you do the oil change in your pressure washer’s motor.</p><p></p><h3>What sort of oil should be used in a Honda tiny engine?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>SAE 10W-30 Motor Oil is a synthetic motor oil with a high viscosity index of 30.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>A Honda gcv160 runs on a particular kind of oil.</h3><p>In my GCV160, I use whatever oil I happen to have laying in the garage.
