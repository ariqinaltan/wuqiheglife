According to <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, Chastain's parents had her when they were only teenagers and following the birth of her younger sister, Juliet, Chastain's mother <a href=#>reportedly</a> left her father. Chastain then became estranged from him and years later didn't attend his funeral. She even told Vogue (via <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>), that his name isn't on her birth certificate, saying, "There's no proof of anything." Instead, Chastain seemingly considers her stepfather as her real dad, since she said that meeting him brought a sense of safety into her life.</p><p dir=ltr>It appears that the family had also struggled to make ends meet. As Chastain revealed to <a href=#>The Irish Times</a>, "​​We did not have money. There were many nights when we had to go to sleep without eating." She reiterated how hard it was to <a href=#>USA Today</a>, explaining, "We were evicted a couple times when I was a child ... I always had this fear of being homeless."</p><p dir=ltr>Later in life, Chastain's sister committed suicide at age 24 after struggling with drug addiction. "She had a lot of attempted suicides, but you never really think this is going to happen ... And when you get the call, it's... shocking," Chastain told <a href=#>Modern Luxury</a>. Because of all she's been through, Chastain is reluctant to speak about her past, telling <a href=#>The Times</a>, "When people see me, I think they expect a different background than I have."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing 988 or by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmxgaoB3e9ahmK1lqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWamsC0tcKaZJygkajBorXNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-eli-tomac.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Eli Tomac?</span></a>
