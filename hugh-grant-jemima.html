He had previously been expected to steer clear of the event, with newspapers suggesting Jemima was uncomfortable with the close friendship between him and the Estée Lauder model.</p><p id=e2y3KG-s1ijO data-wc=81>And it has also been rumoured the screen star will give the bride a rather unusual wedding present. If speculation turns out to be correct, he will be presenting the glamorous mum-of-one - with whom he shares a production company called Simian Films - a chimpanzee. The eyebrow-raising gesture is apparently a reference to comments she has made in the past about his looks. "We named our company that way because I think Hugh looks like a chimp," she once said.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
