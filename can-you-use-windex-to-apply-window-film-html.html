 Use of Windex or any other home cleaners on the glass is not recommended since the film may not adhere properly and the chemicals in the cleaners may break down the polycarbonate. Once the glass has been cleaned, either wipe it dry or allow it to air dry. Using a straight edge, cut the film to the appropriate size.
