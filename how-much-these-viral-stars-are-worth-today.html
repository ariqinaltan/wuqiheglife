For example, in 2007, the "<a href=#>Charlie Bit My Finger</a>" video apparently brought the family that uploaded it "tens of thousands" of British pounds, according to <a href=#>Business Insider</a>. Howard Davies-Carr, the father of the boys in the famous video, told the outlet he only initially shared the clip with certain friends and family before "it became difficult to maintain a list of who could watch the video." So, he changed the video to "public"&nbsp;and the rest is viral history.&nbsp;</p><p>By 2012, the adorable clip reached over 400 million views and raked in "about $160,000" in ad revenues on YouTube, according to <a href=#>Newser</a>. By 2017, the views more than doubled, earning the family an astounding "$1.3 million in royalties" (per <a href=#>The Mirror</a>). In addition to money, the video also led to advertisements, public appearances, and travel for the family.</p><p>In a roundabout way, "Charlie Bit My Finger" led to the Davies-Carr family having more children. "Without the clip, we couldn't have had Rupert," Shelley Davies-Carr, Charlie's mother, told the tab of her youngest child (the family now has four boys).&nbsp;So now kids with YouTube dreams can tell their parents that they're filming everything they do because they're trying to start a family!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjaX54e8eormalpZi1bsDHnqqeZaaev6K4jKyrmqqjYq6zsYywpqusmGLBsLDAsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-sheila-frazier-make-latest-sheila-frazier-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Sheila Frazier Make?
