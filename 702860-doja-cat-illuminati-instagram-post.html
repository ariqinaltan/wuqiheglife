For several months now, she's been faced with accusations of selling her soul to join the Illuminati, especially now that her music has taken a devilish turn in nature. Doja does seem to have become annoyed by the discourse on more than one occasion, but in her usual fashion, she's been playing the latest gossip about her off like a pro.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Saturday (August 12), the Grammy Award winner showed off her budding graphic design skills by putting together a unique collage. The mostly pink image shows a distorted Doja sitting on the side of a bed, her arms thrown up in the air. Beside her sits a pink sparkly Care Bare, a stream of falling money, and a shooting star. "ILLUMINATITS," "I think my cat is Illuminati," and "I joined the Illuminati" all flash across the screen in obnoxious fonts as well.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-doja-cat-is-a-proud-illuminati-member>Doja Cat is a Proud Illuminati Member</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It's true üíÖüèΩ," the embattled entertainer further noted in her caption, sarcastically confirming the IlluminaTEA. The response to that post has been varied, but Doja doesn't seem too bothered by what others have to say. Instead, she's been busy photoshopping images of her booty cheeks over cheese poptarts.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I j be talkin my shi ü§™," she captioned that post. It was followed shortly after by some interesting bikini snaps, laid out on a Hello Kitty background in the same way as the others. "Hating me won't make you pretty," is one of the messages the multi-talent chose to share along with her thirst traps.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-graphic-design-is-her-passion>Graphic Design is Her Passion</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keep scrolling to see what other interesting posts have appeared on Doja Cat's Instagram feed this afternoon.
