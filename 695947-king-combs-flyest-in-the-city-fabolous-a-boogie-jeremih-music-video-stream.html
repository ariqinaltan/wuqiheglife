Moreover, there's the Yung Miami-assisted bonus song "Shake It," plus a team-up with Swae Lee titled "Fatal Attraction." However, nowhere else do guests make more of an impact than on the stacked, chemistry-filled, and groovy "Flyest in The City." Not only does the cut showcase a vibrant, classic-sounding, and crisp beat from Hitmaka and Cardiak, but it hosts plenty of melodic and lyrical talent. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Fabolous</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie</a> rep New York alongside Combs, and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jeremih</a> joins the track with some beautiful harmonies.</p><p>Furthermore, what makes "Flyest in The City" stand out is how all these voices coalesce and mesh with each other. Even though it might seem like a mess of artists together on paper, there's actually a lot of synergy between these rhymers and singers. For example, they often provide ad-libs, extra vocal runs, and other small details during each other's contributions. Whereas King Combs and Fabolous come through with heavier hip-hop verses, A Boogie and Jeremih bring the soulful and breezy production to life with their vocalizations. Thanks to shimmering key samples, high-pitched synth runs, a muddy bassline, and piercing but washed-out guitar licks, this song sounds every bit as opulent and luxurious as the cars and jewelry they boast in the music video.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Diddy Reflects On Continuing His Bad Boy Legacy With King Combs</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-combs-flyest-in-the-city-watch-the-music-video>King Combs' "Flyest In The City": Watch The Music Video</h2></span><p>Meanwhile, this is just the latest step in Christan Combs' burgeoning career, for which his father <a href=# class=text-word rel>Diddy</a> has accompanied him every step of the way. Sure, their relationship has obviously brought forth a lot of discussion and criticism due to accusations of nepotism and having everything handed to him. <a href=# rel>He doesn't see it that way,</a> and if he keeps up the momentum with quality tracks like these, then he probably doesn't need the help to begin with.
