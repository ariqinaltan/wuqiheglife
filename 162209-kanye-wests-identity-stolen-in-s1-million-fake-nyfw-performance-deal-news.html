However, it's because his identity was stolen. The multi-platinum recording artist may not have even realized that he had unintentionally inked a $1 million deal to perform at NYFW because it turns out that his signature was forged by a fraudster. According to TMZ, somebody that Ye knows contacted Philipp Plein, misrepresenting himself as the rapper's official representative. When he started to negotiate prices to perform, Plein fell for the trap and actually wired over $900K as an advance for Ye's performance. The deal was worth approximately $1 million in total.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The publication notes that the identity&nbsp;theft was undertaken by one of Kanye's former friends and an associate of G.O.O.D. Music. Philipp Plein now has two problems; he's not getting a Kanye West appearance and he's out of nearly $1 mil. We wouldn't be surprised to hear if legal action is taken shortly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdha39zfJhmopqmqZp6uLHSrapmoZSau7W107JkrKyfobKvecinZKxpXaK2rbjIqKVmnpGgsm662J%2BuZqiVp7OwvsyapZydXZmyoriMp5ywqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1528627-digital-church-list-top-10-young-nigerian-pastors-earning-millions-youtube-morning-prayers-wave.html><span>←</span><span>Jerry Eze N3m Daily: Top Nigerian Pastors Earning Millions on YouTube Amid Morning Prayers Wave</span></a>
