Because I don’t want to go on like this.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eLfG6Ve6r2zc data-wc=73>Back in 2017, he told GQ: “We're both doing our best. I heard one lawyer say, 'No one wins in court—it's just a matter of who gets hurt worse. I just refuse. And fortunately my partner in this agrees. It’s just very, very jarring for the kids, to suddenly have their family ripped apart…. If anyone can make sense of it, we have to with great care and delicacy, building everything around that.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
