The long dress puddled at the floor, though her metallic platform heels peeked through the sheer material. Cushion-cut diamond drop earrings, a matching ear cuff, and several silver rings accessorized the statement piece, and her dark hair was slicked back into a wet-looking style that cascaded down her back, save for one strand that framed her face. Her simple glam included a bronzy complexion and a severe winged liner.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The luggage mogul (she founded well-known travel essentials brand <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Béis Travel</a>) was joined by Raissa Gerona, Elsa Hosk, Jasmine Tookes, and Jasmin Hekmat&nbsp;at the event, and the group of stars posed for photos on a bench in front of lots of greenery.

She recently opened up to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Elle</a> about starting her company, and as a frequent traveler, she noticed a "gap in the market" for affordable, functional, and stylish luggage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Basically, I wanted a line of affordable bags that had all the function I could dream up and look really good at the same time," she explained. "The price was really important to me, because I know how expensive traveling is — I don’t want the bags to break the bank because you should be able to spend that money on the experiences you have. It’s an on-the-go brand, whether you’re going on a hike, to the gym, or to the grocery store. I want to provide different accessories for all of those different things, so everyone can have the bag that makes them feel at home when they’re not at home."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qGYsmWdnsGktMSlo2ZqYGeAbq%2FAp6Weq12btq25jJ%2BcrKyZq66tedKcrKWopKq%2ForiMsKCrnV2jrqyxw2abq52jqHp4gY9tbG9x</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./og7d2z7nucjmhmy5gc5dvu34hu.html><span>←</span><span>Shades of blackface - Entertainment News</span></a>
