I don’t track my tweets," LeBron said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Stay tuned to HNHH for more news and updates from around the NBA world.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
