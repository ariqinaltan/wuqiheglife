While he wasn't too bothered about that, he started speaking with Tory's manager, who asked Prince to take down one&nbsp;post that they believed insinuated that the song was stolen. After he agreed and made nice with Tory's team, the two met up at the club but Tory was allegedly unaware that Prince had been talking to his manager. He went up to the man and punched him right in the face, according to Prince.</p><p>Jerritt Clark/Getty Images --&nbsp;Saweetie poses with her parents Jonathan and Trinidad&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That's not all Prince had to say during the interview. He also spoke about his alleged relationship with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Saweetie's mother Trinidad Valentin</a>. "A long time ago, before Saweetie got really, really big, I used to take care of her mom when she came to Miami," said Prince. "One time she came, I think it was her fiftieth birthday, and I was just really attentive. I showed her a really good time. We ended up just staying in really close contact after that. I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;think anything is going to happen, like a relationship or anything like that. I think it was more so this young kid who has all this potential and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">someone that's&nbsp;giving her attention</a>. We shared some messages and some moments."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tasha K dug a little deeper, asking if he was intimate with Saweetie's mom, which he denies. "I am a gentleman and a scholar but no, we didn't end up going all the way or nothing like that.&nbsp;Me and Saweetie's mom, we just had a close relationship. It never got to get to that point. Nah. I have a lot of respect for Saweetie and I have a lot of respect for Saweetie's mom.
