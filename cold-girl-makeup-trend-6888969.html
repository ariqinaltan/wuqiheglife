But what exactly is it?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything you need to know.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-the-cold-girl-makeup-trend></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is the cold girl makeup trend?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cold girl makeup trend is essentially exactly what it sounds like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The goal is to look flushed with a hint of sparkle, as if you were just outside building a snowman. Think of it as an après-ski look without having to actually go skiing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The best part is the fact that the staples you need to create the look are most likely already in your makeup bag, which is always a bonus.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram @haileybieber</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-create-the-cold-girl-makeup-look></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Create the Cold Girl Makeup Look</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step one: Blush</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First and foremost, remember that there’s no such thing as too much blush.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, you'll want to generously apply your favorite cool tone pink blush to the apples of your cheeks, moving up to the high points of your cheekbones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, if you don’t happen to have a cool tone pink, fear not, just use your go-to blush instead. Pro tip: make sure you apply your blush to your nose, with an emphasis on the tip. This technique really embodies what it looks like when you’re outside in the cold.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step two: Shimmer</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your next order of business is to add a silvery highlight to all the high points of your face. This includes the arches of your brow bones, your cheek bones, the inner corner of the eyes, and my personal favorite, down the bridge and tip of your nose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Who needs Rudolph when your nose could be shining bright enough to guide the sleigh? The silver shimmer adds the same nostalgic effect of snowflakes when the light hits just right.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step three: Lip Color</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>Last but not least, a signature part of being a cold girl is having that just bitten lip. A great way to create this is by applying your favorite lip stain in the centre of your lips — but a red or berry toned lipstick will work just as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Focus the product on the center of your lips and diffuse the edges with your fingers. The cherry on top will be applying your favorite silver shimmer gloss to make everything cohesive. This frozen vibe will make your lips pop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">See my full tutorial, below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqijnWWXnr%2Btecyaop6toGLBs7HNnWRvcGhthneF</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gloria-modern-family-carnitas-al-diablo-recipe.html><span>←</span><span>Get Gloria from Modern Family's Carnitas al Diablo Recipe</span></a>
