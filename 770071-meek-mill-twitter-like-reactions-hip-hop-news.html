Moreover, many people speculated on their alleged intimate relationship and history, which he took to social media to blast outright. Unfortunately for the Philadelphia MC, this means that folks will scrutinize and criticize his activity on social media and elsewhere much more closely. As such, it didn't take fans long to spot a post that he liked on Twitter that raised a lot of eyebrows. In it, a fan seemingly approaches the Dream Chasers rapper and speaks to him as he chills out in a pool.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Meek mill cooling 'em cakes after all night of bender [crying-laughing emoji]," the tweet's caption read. In addition, the use of words like "daddy" and "king size" also made fans chuckle in the replies and question why he would even like this. Also, the tweet is a reply to a meme about <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the Diddy allegations</a> and his industry proximities. Of course, it's always possible that this could just be a hack of some sort, but it seems like a pretty light and innocuous instance if that's the case. After all, there's a lot more you could do with Meek's Twitter account.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-meek-mill-gives-twitter-like-to-bizarre-post-fans-question-it>Meek Mill Gives Twitter Like To Bizarre Post, Fans Question It</h2></span><p>Screenshot via Twitter @MeekMill</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, fans already saw how this whole debacle and slew of claims, allegations, and discoveries resulted in some combative responses from him. For example, Meek Mill reignited <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his beef with DJ Akademiks</a> given that the media personality was the main media source pointing to his involvement in the Diddy lawsuit. It got pretty nasty between the two, who had previously engaged in and then squashed beef, but that didn't last long. Other than that, most of his responses to people that weren't Ak were much more general and unspecific.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Fivio Foreign recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">came forward to defend his collaborator</a>. "The streets ah never a weird industry n**** take out a n**** like meek..," he expressed on Twitter on Wednesday (February 28). "He do too much for the trenches. We gon hold each other down from now on it’s 2024.. It’s Blue World Order."

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbH1xg5BmpJ6dm2K6qrjLZquwoaSpsrN5y6KinmWimq6kwMiopaxlmJ69brTOqWSnnaeo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./destinations.html><span>←</span><span>M.Ou.Co Hotel Review, Porto | Telegraph Travel</span></a>
