The fantasy comedy series first aired on both Amazon Prime and BBC Network nearly three years ago. As the series ramps up for another season of the faithful adaptation of the cult favorite <a href=#>Neil Gaiman</a>-Terry Pratchett novel, the <a href=#>casting </a>news boasts some promising newcomers, but also a few fan-favorites who will not be reprising their roles for the impending season.</p><p>As reported Wednesday by <a href=#>Deadline</a>, the new season will remain with Amazon Studios and the partnership with BBC Studios Productions. Good Omens Season 2 will once again bring back the show’s frontrunners Michael Sheen as Aziraphale the Angel and David Tennant as Crowly the demon. Also reprising their roles from the first season are Derek Jacobi as Metatron and Jon Hamm as Gabriel. Similarly, Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Niamh Walsh will all return for another round. The impressive ensemble will also boast some new faces in season 2 as Dame Siân Phillips, Tim Downie, Peter Firman, Andi Osho, and Alex Norton are set to appear in the upcoming season. To many’s disappointment, the news also revealed that season one veterans <a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch</a> and Frances McDormand, who voiced Satan and God respectively, will not reprise their roles in season 2. As disappointing as the news may be, fans remain hopeful as Deadline reports that there still remains to be a few celebrity names appearing in the next season that haven’t been announced yet.</p><p>As filming continues in Scottland, the new six-episode season is largely under wraps. While the first season’s six episodes explored the storylines from the original source material, Good Omens Season 2 season is set to go into uncharted territory as the comedy continues to highlight the bizarre friendship between Aziraphale and Crowley. It’s still unknown when the new episodes will air, but it’s likely we won’t see the beloved characters return to screen until the end of this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/goodomens-900x600.jpeg><p>Based on the eponymous novel from satirical authors Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, Good Omens aired as a fantasy comedy that brings a dark comedic twist to biblical characters. Following the fairly odd duo of main characters, the longtime acquaintances who have grown fond of their lives on Earth as representatives to Heaven and Hell. As the first season’s plot details the impending apocalypse, Crowley and Aziraphale team up to stop the Antichrist and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to save life on Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>First airing in 2019, Good Omens boasted instant approval and succes. The series sits pretty on <a href=#>Rotten Tomatoes</a> with an approval rating of 84%. With endearing characters, an intriguing plot, and delightful character dynamics, at its heart, Good Omens is a feel-good show. And as fans ramp up for Good Omens Season 2, the recent casting lineup is surely enough reason to get excited for the next chapter in the story. Speaking of the next season, Neil Gaiman said, “We are so thrilled that we were able to get so many fabulous actors to return to the Good Omens family. Some of them are reprising roles, some of them are playing completely new characters. And we are just as thrilled by the people coming to the Good Omens team for the first time. We have an ensemble cast of astonishing talent, and seeing what they’re giving us is a daily treat. I can’t wait until the rest of the world gets that treat, too.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ifn6SxbrvMnqWsZaOarrS7zWZpZpuRqMFvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gerry-beckley-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-2-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gerry Beckley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
