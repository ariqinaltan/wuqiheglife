He took the stage as a surprise, where he performed his&nbsp;DUMMY BOY hit, “BEBE.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/68/87/438768_dc5170caadb98ffd586c7f57ceaa200a.jpeg><p><h6>John Parra/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Ak’s clip shows the crowd feeling the show, several Twitter users have reported that the New Yorker was boo’d by the crowd. “6ix9ine is at Miami Bash and holy f*ck he’s so bad I have second hand embarrassment,” one person wrote. “[People] are walking out and using him as a bathroom break.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“The crowd booing 6ix9ine when he got off the stage at Miami Bash,” someone else added. When someone questioned why their recounting was different from what video footage shows they responded, “I mean, idk I was at the concert and no one was excited [because] it was a ‘surprise.’” They later added, “as soon as the light turned off, everyone booed. And not a lot of people were singing lol.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It remains unclear exactly what the conditions at Miami Bash were like during the “FEFE” rapper’s performance, but he seems to be slowly making his way back onto the stage following a messy few years in and out of the spotlight.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">6ix9ine himself hasn’t posted anything about the show on his own Instagram page – in fact, he’s been seemingly off the grid since earlier this year, only occasionally showing up for special moments like his girlfriend’s birthday, during which he spoiled her with three gorgeous Birkin bags;&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">read more about that here.</a></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
