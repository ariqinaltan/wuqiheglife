Heart-shaped Box
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak,
I've been locked inside your heart shaped box for weeks.
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap,
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black...Hey, wait,
I got a new complaint,
Forever in debt to your priceless advice,

Three in the morning, and I'm still awake
So I picked up a pen and a page
And I started writing just what I'd say
If we were face to faceI'd tell you just what you mean to me
Tell you these simple truths
Chorus
Be strong in the Lord
And never give up hope
You're gonna do great things
I already know
God's got His hand on You
So don't live life in fear</article><article class=post-entry><h2>50 Cent Hit With $3M Defamation Lawsuit By HipHopDX: Report</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>
