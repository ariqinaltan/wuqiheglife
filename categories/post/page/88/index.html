Rashida Jones—the television news executive, not the actress—spent her early childhood in York, Pennsylvania, a small town in the center of the state where she was the oldest of the three “Adkins kids,” as students and teachers in the nearly all-white school referred to young Rashida and her siblings.

Sofia Vergara has explained that her Spanish accent (she was born in Colombia) limits the opportunities she gets offered in Hollywood.
And while Vergara's admission was expressed "playfully," fans are saddened by what it implies about society as it is.
