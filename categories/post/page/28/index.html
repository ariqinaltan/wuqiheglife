John Jesse, who has died aged 83, was a decorative art dealer whose keen eye for the rare, the beautiful – and the downright bizarre – attracted millionaire collectors, including Andy Warhol, Barbra Streisand, Brad Pitt, Michael Caine, Luchino Visconti and Paul McCartney, to his small shop at the top end of Kensington Church Street in London.
He began trading in the early 1960s, when he rented a stall in Portobello Road antiques market and became interested in Art Nouveau, which was generally regarded as kitsch – so much so that a “rather grand lady” customer told him that his 1890s Gallé vases, Mucha posters and Tiffany lamps were lowering the tone of the place.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Juliette Porters biography: what is known about the Siesta Key star?</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

LaMelo Ball is easily one of the most exciting young point guards in the NBA right now. His passing is incredible and he is starting to shoot the ball better too. Unfortunately, he has proven to be injury prone, and it could cost his Hornets their season.
For instance, Ball missed the first few games of the season as he was dealing with an ankle injury sustained in the preseason. The Hornets were terrible in his absence, which was to be expected.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lena Headey Says What Cersei Lannister's Thinking on Game of Thrones</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

One of the many reasons I love Lena Headey (besides her ability to be raw and real with fans) is that she brings a little levity into the experience of playing&nbsp;Cersei Lannister. I can only imagine how&nbsp;seriously&nbsp;intense playing one of the most complex and honestly one of the most hated characters on&nbsp;GoT&nbsp;must be. But Lena always finds the nuance in her role, or in the case of a post this morning, some hilarious insight into what the current Queen of the Seven Kingdoms is really thinking.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Los mejores anillos de compromiso de las famosas</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

Megan Thee Stallion has&nbsp;become one of the game's biggest rising rappers, approaching near-superstar status without having delivered an official debut album. And while what constitutes a "debut" these days has become a widely-debated issue, many fans acknowledge that Megan's choice to brand it as such speaks volumes about&nbsp;Good News.&nbsp;It's likely she'll have a lot to say on the upcoming project, especially given everything that transpired in her personal life, and perhaps we'll see a more introspective side to the Houston rapper.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/post/page/27/>← Prev Page</a>
