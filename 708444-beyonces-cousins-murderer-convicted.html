She had quite a bit of evidence working against her, including security footage, witness testimonies, and more. With that being said, after around two hours of deliberation, the jury found her guilty of murder. The verdict was read aloud in court today, and she didn't appear to have much of a reaction at all.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">DeRouen was a 34-year-old up-and-coming rapper who performed under the name Kardone. Back in 2021, Skare reportedly got into a verbal altercation with him at his apartment, leading him to tell her to leave. She was then captured by neighbors' Ring cameras walking through the halls of the building holding a gun, and according to reports, fired a single shot through the door. Neighbors claim they heard banging on the door, as well as the gunshot. The woman who lived across the hall from DeRouen also says she saw Skare pounding on his door just before his murder.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sasha-skare-sentenced-to-55-years-in-prison>Sasha Skare Sentenced To 55 Years In Prison</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During the trial, audio from a 911 call made by Skare also showcased her claiming to be DeRouen’s wife, Joia. She told dispatchers that she was locked out of the apartment and had been injured. Joia, however, says that it wasn't her that made the call. “She pronounced the last name wrong,” she explained in court. “My name starts with a J and not a G. He was not 28, he was 34. Not correct at all.”&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
