Overall, this is a sneaker that has some very nice aesthetics to it. There is that chunky dad shoe quality that a lot of fans appreciate. Although it may not be the most popular Air Max, it certainly serves a great purpose. Throughout the years, this shoe has received a ton of amazing colorways, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">and even some collaborations.</a> Despite a period of dormancy, this shoe is making a bit of a comeback.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, this should come as great news for sneakerheads. The <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Nike</a> Air Max Plus is one of those shoes that works really well in the warmer months. Additionally, there are still plenty of great colorways that have not been tried yet. The tooling on this shoe lends itself well to some very unique offerings. Now, it seems like Nike is taking inspiration from the new Spider-Man: Across The Spiderverse movie that is coming out. Although it's not an official collab, this kids-exclusive colorway will make some noise.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-spider-man-nike-air-max-plus>"Spider-Man" Nike Air Max Plus</h2></span><p>Image via Nike</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As you can immediately tell, the Spider-Man aesthetics here are immediately evident. Although, this shoe does a great job of doing its own thing at the same time. Firstly, the base of the sneaker is mostly just black. Secondly, all of the ripples that go up through the upper are red and blue. This creates a dope illusion that will have you immediately thinking of the aforementioned superhero. Once again, Nike has done a great job with the Air Max Plus.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At the time of writing this, a release date has yet to be revealed for this new Nike Air Max Plus. However, it should be dropping very soon for a price of $145 USD. If your kid loves Spider-Man, then these will be a must-cop. Let us know your thoughts on these kicks, in the comments section below.
