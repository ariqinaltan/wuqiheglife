Kelly Beat Wallo In Prison Talent Show, Gillie Da Kid Claims</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2023/11/GettyImages-1430248403.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Gillie Da Kid</a> is having a bit of fun on social media. In the wild world of hip-hop and street legends, there's no shortage of stories and surprising journeys to the top. Wallo 267, now a celebrated motivational speaker and the charismatic host of the viral podcast Million Dollaz Worth of Game, is no exception to this rule. Moreover, before he became a public figure in the culture, he did time. In fact, he served a 20-year sentence in the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections for an armed robbery conviction. Wallo's life story took a sharp turn as he entered prison at the tender age of 17 and emerged as a free man at 37. This was documented in a Change.org petition. Currently, he's navigating the terrain of probation, and his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">tales from behind bars</a> have become legendary. They've been featured as hilarious segments on his popular podcast.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Gillie Da Kid, a Philly rap figure who's no stranger to the industry, and part of the Major Figgas group with Wallo, recently took to social media for some playful fun at his cousin's expense. Gillie da King is playfully poking fun at his cousin Wallo for his extensive prison term. Gillie humorously captioned an Instagram post featuring <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">R. Kelly singing "Bump and Grind,"</a> suggesting that Wallo's prison talent show wins might not have continued if <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>R. Kelly</a> were his competition. Regardless of how entertaining Wallo's performances were. This lighthearted banter showcases the strong family bond and the unique humor within the hip-hop community.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-gillie-da-kid-pokes-fun-at-wallo>Gillie Da Kid Pokes Fun At Wallo</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">@wallo267</a>&nbsp;won 3 straight prison talent shows he wouldn’t of won a 4th with R in there I don’t care how much twerking Lo Did," he wrote. Gillie shared an Instagram post featuring R. Kelly, the R&B maestro, belting out his classic hit "Bump and Grind" acapella. It's clear that the two never miss an opportunity to tease each other. However, in this case, Gillie playfully suggests that Wallo's prison talent show victories might have met their match if he had to contend with R. Kelly's vocals behind bars.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's all in good fun, and this light-hearted banter between the two cousins showcases the resilience, humor, and camaraderie that exists within the hip-hop community. Even when recounting tales of life behind prison walls. Wallo's journey from incarceration to podcast stardom is nothing short of inspirational, and it's heartwarming to see his family members, like Gillie, celebrating his success with a sprinkle of humor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaH53fpBmqWajlaG5unnBnpitZaeWua27jKmpoqufo3q1rcuepa1lo528uHnGoqOloZVisaJ5yqKb</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./proof-that-reality-tv-is-completely-fake.html><span>←</span><span>Proof That Reality TV Is Completely Fake</span></a>
